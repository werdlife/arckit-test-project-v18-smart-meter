# Data Source Discovery Guide

`/arckit.datascout` discovers external data sources — APIs, datasets, open data portals, and commercial providers — that can fulfil a project's data and integration requirements.

---

## What is Data Source Discovery?

Data source discovery is the systematic identification and evaluation of external data sources that a project needs. Rather than building internal data collection from scratch, many projects can consume existing APIs, open datasets, and commercial data feeds.

**Key question**: What external data does the project need, and where can it be sourced?

---

## When to Use

- **After requirements** are defined (MANDATORY — data needs come from DR-xxx, FR-xxx, INT-xxx)
- **Before or alongside data modeling** — discovered sources influence the data model
- **Before vendor procurement** — data source costs feed into TCO analysis
- **When requirements reference external data** (e.g., "display real-time prices", "validate postcode", "show company details")

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

| Artifact | Dependency | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Requirements (`ARC-*-REQ-*.md`) | **MANDATORY** | Data needs extracted from DR/FR/INT/NFR requirements |
| Data Model (`ARC-*-DATA-*.md`) | OPTIONAL | Maps sources to existing entities, identifies gaps |
| Stakeholders (`ARC-*-STKE-*.md`) | RECOMMENDED | Prioritises sources by stakeholder needs |
| Principles (`ARC-000-PRIN-*.md`) | RECOMMENDED | Applies open data and cloud-first principles |

## Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Prompt seed | Focus |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Open data first | "Discover UK Government open data sources for <project>" | Prioritises data.gov.uk, ONS, NHS Digital |
| Commercial APIs | "Find commercial data APIs for <capability>" | Compares pricing, SLAs, coverage |
| Gap analysis | "Identify which data requirements have no external source" | Highlights gaps needing internal collection |
| Data model enrichment | "Find sources to populate the data model for <project>" | Maps sources to existing entities |
| Cost analysis | "Compare free vs commercial data sources for <need>" | TCO comparison for data feeds |

Add constraints (budget, data residency, freshness) in the prompt for tailored results.

## Command

```bash
/arckit.datascout Discover data sources for <project>
```

Outputs: `projects/<id>/ARC-<id>-DSCT-v1.0.md`

---

## Output Highlights

- **Data needs analysis** extracted from requirements (DR/FR/INT/NFR)
- **Data utility analysis** identifying secondary and alternative uses for each source beyond the primary requirement (e.g., satellite imagery → oil storage estimation → price prediction; smart meter data → energy monitoring + fuel poverty identification)
- **Per-source evaluation cards** with license, pricing, API details, quality, compliance
- **Weighted scoring matrix** (Requirements Fit 25%, Data Quality 20%, License & Cost 15%, API Quality 15%, Compliance 15%, Reliability 10%)
- **Side-by-side comparison tables** per category
- **Gap analysis** for unmet data needs with recommended actions
- **Data model impact** (new entities, attributes, sync strategy)
- **Requirements traceability** (every DR-xxx mapped to a source or flagged as gap)
- **UK Government open data opportunities** (TCoP Point 10 compliance)

## Evaluation Criteria Explained

| Criterion | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Requirements Fit** | 25% | Covers required data fields, scope, granularity, volume |
| **Data Quality** | 20% | Accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness |
| **License & Cost** | 15% | OGL vs commercial, pricing sustainability, total cost |
| **API Quality** | 15% | RESTful, documentation, SDKs, versioning, error handling |
| **Compliance** | 15% | GDPR, UK data residency, classification, DPA 2018 |
| **Reliability** | 10% | SLA, uptime, vendor stability, support |

## UK Government Open Data Guidance

For UK Government projects, datascout prioritises open data sources:

### Key UK Open Data Portals

| Portal | URL | Coverage |
|--------|-----|----------|
| data.gov.uk | https://www.data.gov.uk/ | Central UK open data |
| ONS | https://www.ons.gov.uk/ | Statistics and demographics |
| NHS Digital | https://digital.nhs.uk/ | Health and social care |
| OS Data Hub | https://osdatahub.os.uk/ | Geospatial data |
| Companies House | https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/ | Company data |
| Environment Agency | https://environment.data.gov.uk/ | Environmental data |
| Land Registry | https://use-land-property-data.service.gov.uk/ | Property data |
| Police API | https://data.police.uk/docs/ | Crime data |

### TCoP Point 10: Make Better Use of Data

The Technology Code of Practice requires UK Government projects to:
- Consume existing open data before building new data collection
- Use common data standards and identifiers (UPRN, company number, etc.)
- Consider publishing project data as open data (OGL)
- Comply with the Data Ethics Framework

## Integration with Other Commands

| Direction | Command | Integration |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Input** | `/arckit.requirements` | Data needs from DR/FR/INT/NFR requirements |
| **Input** | `/arckit.data-model` | Existing entities needing external data |
| **Output** | `/arckit.data-model` | New entities/attributes from discovered sources |
| **Output** | `/arckit.research` | Data source costs inform vendor TCO |
| **Output** | `/arckit.adr` | Data source selection recorded as decisions |
| **Output** | `/arckit.dpia` | Third-party sources assessed for privacy |
| **Output** | `/arckit.diagram` | Data flow diagrams show external integration |
| **Output** | `/arckit.traceability` | DR-xxx → data source mapping |

---

## Follow-on Actions

- Update data model with external data entities (`/arckit.data-model`)
- Create ADRs for significant data source decisions (`/arckit.adr`)
- Conduct DPIA for sources with personal data (`/arckit.dpia`)
- Feed data source costs into research TCO analysis (`/arckit.research`)
- Build data flow diagrams showing external integration (`/arckit.diagram`)
- Add data source risks to risk register (`/arckit.risk`)
