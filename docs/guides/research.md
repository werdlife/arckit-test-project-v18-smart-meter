# Technology Research Guide

`/arckit.research` investigates market, SaaS, open-source, and government marketplace options to support build vs buy decisions.

> **Agent Architecture**: This command delegates to the `arckit-research` autonomous agent (`.claude/agents/arckit-research.md`). The agent runs as a subprocess with its own context window, performing dozens of WebSearch and WebFetch calls for vendor pricing, reviews, and compliance data without polluting your main conversation. The slash command launches the agent and relays its summary back to you.

## Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Prompt seed | Focus |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Build vs buy | “Research options for <capability> and recommend build vs buy” | Compares custom development vs product |
| Supplier shortlist | “Research G-Cloud services for <need> including pricing tiers” | Public sector supplier discovery |
| Standards review | “Research regulatory obligations for <domain>” | Highlights policies, certifications, compliance |
| Migration | “Research tooling to migrate from <legacy> to <target>” | Guides modernisation approaches |
| Risk investigation | “Research security/operational risks for <technology>” | Informs risk register and mitigations |

Add constraints (budget, data residency, clearance) in the prompt for tailored results.
