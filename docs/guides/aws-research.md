# AWS Technology Research Guide

`/arckit.aws-research` researches AWS services, architecture patterns, and implementation guidance using the AWS Knowledge MCP server for authoritative documentation.

> **Agent Architecture**: This command runs as an autonomous agent (`.claude/agents/arckit-aws-research.md`) via the Task tool. The agent makes 15-30+ MCP calls to gather AWS documentation in its own context window, keeping the main conversation clean. The slash command is a thin wrapper that delegates to the agent.

## Prerequisites

### AWS Knowledge MCP Server (REQUIRED)

This command **requires** the AWS Knowledge MCP server to be installed. It will not work without it.

**Installation**:

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` or project `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-knowledge": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws"
    }
  }
}
```

After installation, restart Claude Code to load the MCP server.

### Project Prerequisites

- Requirements document (`ARC-*-REQ-*.md`) - **MANDATORY**
- Data model (`ARC-*-DATA-*.md`) - Recommended for database selection
- Stakeholders (`ARC-*-STKE-*.md`) - Recommended for priorities

## Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Prompt seed | Focus |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Service selection | "Research AWS services for <capability>" | Maps requirements to AWS services |
| Architecture pattern | "Research AWS architecture pattern for <pattern>" | Reference architectures from AWS Architecture Center |
| UK Government | "Research AWS for UK Government <project>" | G-Cloud, eu-west-2, NCSC compliance |
| AI/ML workloads | "Research AWS AI services for <use case>" | Bedrock, SageMaker |
| Migration | "Research AWS migration options for <workload>" | Migration Hub, modernization paths |
| Security assessment | "Research AWS Security Hub for <domain>" | Control mapping, Well-Architected security |

Add constraints (budget, classification, region) in the prompt for tailored results.

## Command

```bash
/arckit.aws-research Research AWS services for <project>
```

Outputs: `projects/<id>/research/ARC-<id>-AWRS-v1.0.md`

---

## MCP Tools Used

The command uses five AWS Knowledge MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_documentation` | Search AWS documentation for services, patterns, best practices |
| `read_documentation` | Retrieve complete documentation pages for detailed analysis |
| `get_regional_availability` | Check service/feature availability in eu-west-2 (London) |
| `list_regions` | Get all AWS regions for multi-region planning |
| `recommend` | Get content recommendations for AWS topics |

---

## Output Highlights

- **AWS Service Recommendations**: Mapped to specific requirements (FR, NFR, INT, DR)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Reference architecture from AWS Architecture Center
- **Well-Architected Assessment**: All 6 pillars evaluated per service (including Sustainability)
- **AWS Security Hub**: Foundational Security Best Practices mapping
- **UK Government Compliance**: G-Cloud, eu-west-2 region, NCSC principles
- **Cost Estimates**: Monthly and 3-year TCO with optimization recommendations
- **Implementation Guidance**: CDK/CloudFormation/Terraform templates

---

## UK Government Features

When UK Government project detected:

| Area | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| **G-Cloud** | Framework reference, service IDs, procurement steps |
| **Data Residency** | eu-west-2 (London) availability via `get_regional_availability` |
| **Classification** | OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE suitability |
| **NCSC** | 14 Cloud Security Principles alignment |
| **Note** | AWS GovCloud is US-only (not available for UK SECRET) |

---

## Follow-on Actions

- Feed AWS findings into `/arckit.diagram` for AWS architecture diagrams
- Run `/arckit.secure` to validate against UK Secure by Design
- Run `/arckit.devops` to plan AWS CodePipeline CI/CD
- Run `/arckit.finops` to create AWS FinOps cost management strategy
- Run `/arckit.adr` to document AWS service selection decisions

## Comparison with /arckit.research

| Feature | `/arckit.research` | `/arckit.aws-research` |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Scope | Multi-cloud, SaaS, open-source | AWS-specific only |
| Source | Web search, multiple sources | AWS Knowledge MCP (authoritative) |
| Depth | Build vs buy analysis | Deep AWS service analysis |
| Regional | General | `get_regional_availability` for eu-west-2 |
| Compliance | General UK Gov | AWS-specific UK compliance |
| Code samples | Limited | CDK, CloudFormation, Terraform |
| Cost estimates | High-level | Detailed AWS pricing |

**When to use which**:
- Use `/arckit.research` for cloud-agnostic evaluation or build vs buy
- Use `/arckit.aws-research` when AWS is the target platform
