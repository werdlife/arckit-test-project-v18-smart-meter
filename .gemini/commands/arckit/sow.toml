Generate Statement of Work (SOW) / RFP document for vendor procurement
"""
prompt = """
You are helping an enterprise architect generate a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) that will be used as an RFP document for vendor procurement.

## User Input

```text
{{args}}
```

## Instructions

1. **Find the project**: The user should specify a project name or number
   - Example: \"Generate SOW for payment gateway modernization\"
   - Example: \"Create SOW for project 001\"
   - If project doesn't exist, create it first using:
     ```bash
     .arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh --name \"project-name\" --json
     ```
     Parse the JSON output to get the project path and ID

2. **Read Available Documents**:

   Scan the project directory for existing artifacts and read them to inform this document:

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - `ARC-*-REQ-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Requirements specification
     - Extract: BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR IDs, priorities, acceptance criteria — source of truth for the SOW
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit.requirements` first
   - `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` in `projects/000-global/` — Architecture principles
     - Extract: Technology standards, constraints, compliance requirements for vendor alignment
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit.principles` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - `ARC-*-RSCH-*.md` or `ARC-*-AWSR-*.md` or `ARC-*-AZUR-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Technology research
     - Extract: Vendor landscape, technology decisions, TCO estimates
   - `ARC-*-STKE-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Stakeholder analysis
     - Extract: Business drivers, success criteria, evaluation priorities

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
   - `ARC-*-RISK-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Risk register
     - Extract: Risks requiring vendor mitigation, risk allocation

   **What to extract from each document**:
   - **Requirements**: All BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR IDs with MUST/SHOULD/MAY priority
   - **Principles**: Technology constraints, compliance requirements for vendors
   - **Research**: Technology decisions, vendor landscape, TCO data
   - **Stakeholders**: Business drivers, success criteria, evaluation priorities

3. **Read the template**: Read `.arckit/templates/sow-template.md` to understand the structure

   > **Note**: Read the `VERSION` file and update the version in the template metadata line when generating.

4. **Check for External Documents** (optional):

   Scan for external (non-ArcKit) documents the user may have provided:

   **Previous SoW Templates & RFP/ITT Documents**:
   - **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/`
   - **File types**: PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), Markdown (.md)
   - **What to extract**: Previous procurement terms, evaluation criteria, contractual clauses, deliverable specifications
   - **Examples**: `previous-sow.pdf`, `rfp-template.docx`, `itt-document.pdf`

   **Procurement Policies**:
   - **Look in**: `projects/000-global/policies/`
   - **File types**: PDF, Word, Markdown
   - **What to extract**: Procurement thresholds, mandatory contractual terms, approved supplier lists, framework agreements
   - **Examples**: `procurement-policy.pdf`, `approved-suppliers.docx`

   **User prompt**: If no external procurement docs found but they would improve the SoW, ask:
   \"Do you have any previous SoW templates, RFP/ITT documents, or procurement policies? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip.\"

   **Important**: This command works without external documents. They enhance output quality but are never blocking.

5. **Generate comprehensive SOW** with these sections:

   **Executive Summary**:
   - Project overview and objectives
   - Expected business outcomes
   - Key success criteria

   **Scope of Work**:
   - What's in scope (explicitly list)
   - What's out of scope (explicitly list)
   - Assumptions and constraints
   - Dependencies

   **Requirements**:
   - Import from ARC-*-REQ-*.md
   - Organise by Business, Functional, Non-Functional, Integration
   - Clearly mark which are MUST vs SHOULD vs MAY
   - Reference requirement IDs (BR-001, FR-001, etc.)

   **Deliverables**:
   - High-Level Design (HLD) document + diagrams
   - Detailed Design (DLD) document
   - Source code and documentation
   - Test plans and test results
   - Deployment runbooks
   - Training materials
   - Warranty and support terms

   **Timeline and Milestones**:
   - Suggested project phases
   - Key milestones and decision gates
   - Review and approval gates (HLD review, DLD review)

   **Vendor Qualifications**:
   - Required certifications
   - Team experience requirements
   - Reference requirements
   - Financial stability requirements

   **Proposal Requirements**:
   - Technical approach and methodology
   - Team composition and CVs
   - Project timeline with milestones
   - Pricing breakdown (fixed-price or T&M)
   - Risk mitigation approach
   - References

   **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - How proposals will be scored
   - Weighting for technical vs cost
   - Mandatory qualifications (pass/fail)
   - Reference to evaluation-criteria-template.md

   **Contract Terms**:
   - Payment terms and milestones
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Change management process
   - Intellectual property rights
   - Warranties and support
   - Termination clauses

6. **Ensure alignment**:
   - Cross-reference architecture principles from any `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` file in `projects/000-global/`
   - Ensure all requirements from the requirements document are included
   - Add validation gates that align with principles

7. **Make it RFP-ready**:
   - Use formal language appropriate for legal review
   - Be specific and unambiguous
   - Include submission instructions and deadline
   - Specify format requirements (e.g., \"proposals must be PDF\")

8. **Write the output**:
   - Write to `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-SOW-v${VERSION}.md`
   - Use the exact template structure




**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 0: Detect Version

Before generating the document ID, check if a previous version exists:

1. Look for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-SOW-v*.md` files in the project directory
2. **If no existing file**: Use VERSION=\"1.0\"
3. **If existing file found**:
   - Read the existing document to understand its scope
   - Compare against current inputs and requirements
   - **Minor increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): Scope unchanged — refreshed content, updated requirements references, corrected details
   - **Major increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0): Scope materially changed — new requirement categories, fundamentally different procurement approach, significant scope changes
4. Use the determined version for document ID, filename, Document Control, and Revision History
5. For v1.1+/v2.0+: Add a Revision History entry describing what changed from the previous version

### Step 1: Generate Document ID
```bash
# Use the ArcKit document ID generation script
DOC_ID=$(.arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh \"${PROJECT_ID}\" \"SOW\" \"${VERSION}\")
# Example output: ARC-001-SOW-v1.0
```

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):
- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., \"001\" from \"projects/001-project-name\")
- `[VERSION]` → Determined version from Step 0
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → Use the document purpose (e.g., \"Business and Technical Requirements\")
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-SOW-v[VERSION]` → Use generated DOC_ID from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → Current command name (e.g., \"arckit.sow\")

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):
- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to \"OFFICIAL\" for UK Gov, \"PUBLIC\" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):
- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to \"Project Team, Architecture Team\" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.sow` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:
```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit.sow` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: [Read from VERSION file]
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### Example Fully Populated Document Control Section:

```markdown
## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | ARC-001-SOW-v1.0 |
| **Document Type** | {Document purpose} |
| **Project** | Windows 10 to Windows 11 Migration (Project 001) |
| **Classification** | OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE |
| **Status** | DRAFT |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Created Date** | 2025-10-29 |
| **Last Modified** | 2025-10-29 |
| **Review Date** | 2025-11-30 |
| **Owner** | John Smith (Business Analyst) |
| **Reviewed By** | [PENDING] |
| **Approved By** | [PENDING] |
| **Distribution** | PM Team, Architecture Team, Dev Team |

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By | Approval Date |
|---------|------|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 1.0 | 2025-10-29 | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.sow` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```


9. **Summarize what you created**:
   - Key scope items
   - Major deliverables
   - Suggested timeline
   - Next steps (e.g., \"Now run `/arckit.evaluate` to create vendor evaluation framework\")

## Example Usage

User: `/arckit.sow Generate SOW for payment gateway modernization project`

You should:
- Find project 001-payment-gateway-modernization
- Read ARC-*-REQ-*.md from that project
- Read architecture principles
- Generate comprehensive SOW:
  - Executive summary with business case
  - Scope: Payment processing, fraud detection, reporting (IN); mobile app (OUT)
  - All requirements from ARC-*-REQ-*.md with IDs
  - Deliverables: HLD, DLD, code, tests, runbooks
  - Timeline: 16 weeks (4 weeks HLD, 4 weeks DLD approval, 8 weeks implementation)
  - Vendor quals: PCI-DSS experience, financial services references
  - Evaluation: 60% technical, 40% cost
  - Contract: Milestone-based payments, 90-day warranty
- **CRITICAL - Token Efficiency**: Use the **Write tool** to create `projects/001-payment-gateway-modernization/ARC-001-SOW-v1.0.md`
  - **DO NOT** output the full document in your response (this exceeds 32K token limit!)
- Show summary only (see Output Instructions below)

## Important Notes

- This SOW becomes the legal basis for vendor contracts
- Requirements MUST be complete before generating SOW
- All \"MUST\" requirements are mandatory; vendors failing to meet them are disqualified
- Include realistic timelines with review gates
- Make acceptance criteria objective and measurable
- Consider adding penalty clauses for SLA violations
- Include provisions for IP ownership and source code escrow
