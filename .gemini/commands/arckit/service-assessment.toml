## Process

### Step 0: Capture ArcKit Version

- Read the `VERSION` file and store the value as `ARC_VERSION`.
- Use this exact value (no hardcoded fallback) anywhere you reference the ArcKit version in the report metadata.

### Step 1: Identify Project Context

Determine which ArcKit project directory to analyze:
- If user provides project name/number: Use that directory
- Otherwise: Look for most recently modified project in `projects/` directory
- Extract project name, scope, and phase information

### Step 2: Read Available Documents

Scan the project directory for existing artifacts and read them to inform this assessment:

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
- `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` in `projects/000-global/` — Architecture principles
  - Extract: Technology standards, compliance requirements, governance constraints
  - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit.principles` first
- `ARC-*-REQ-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Requirements specification
  - Extract: User stories, acceptance criteria, NFRs, accessibility requirements
  - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit.requirements` first

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
- `ARC-*-STKE-*.md` — Stakeholder analysis (user needs, personas, RACI)
- `ARC-*-RISK-*.md` — Risk register (security risks, mitigation strategies)
- `ARC-*-PLAN-*.md` — Project plan (phases, timeline, team structure)
- `ARC-*-SOBC-*.md` — Business case (benefits, success metrics)
- `ARC-*-DATA-*.md` — Data model (GDPR compliance, data governance)
- `ARC-*-DIAG-*.md` in `diagrams/` — Architecture diagrams (C4, deployment)
- `ARC-*-DEVO-*.md` — DevOps strategy (deployment, monitoring)
- `ARC-*-SECD-*.md` — Secure by Design assessment
- `ARC-*-DPIA-*.md` — DPIA (privacy protection evidence)
- `ARC-*-HLDR-*.md` or `ARC-*-DLDR-*.md` in `reviews/` — Design reviews
- `ARC-*-TRAC-*.md` — Traceability matrix

**OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
- `ARC-*-TCOP-*.md` — TCoP review (technology compliance)
- `ARC-*-AIPB-*.md` — AI Playbook assessment (if AI components)
- `ARC-*-ATRS-*.md` — ATRS record (if algorithmic tools)
- `ARC-*-SOW-*.md` — Statement of work
- `ARC-*-EVAL-*.md` — Vendor evaluation
- `ARC-*-ANLZ-*.md` — Governance analysis
- `ARC-*-WARD-*.md` in `wardley-maps/` — Strategic analysis
- `ARC-*-RSCH-*.md` or `ARC-*-AWSR-*.md` or `ARC-*-AZUR-*.md` — Technology research

**What to extract from each document**:
- **Principles**: Technology standards, compliance requirements
- **Requirements**: User stories, acceptance criteria, accessibility NFRs
- **Stakeholders**: User needs, personas, research evidence
- **Risk**: Security considerations, mitigation evidence
- **Diagrams**: Architecture decisions, technology choices
- **DevOps**: Deployment strategy, monitoring, reliability evidence

### Step 2b: Check for External Documents (optional)

Scan for external (non-ArcKit) documents the user may have provided:

**GDS Assessment Feedback & Previous Reports**:
- **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/`
- **File types**: PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), Markdown (.md)
- **What to extract**: Previous assessment results, assessor feedback, action items, evidence gaps identified
- **Examples**: `alpha-assessment-report.pdf`, `assessor-feedback.docx`, `evidence-gaps.md`

**User prompt**: If no external assessment docs found but they would improve preparation, ask:
\"Do you have any previous GDS assessment reports or assessor feedback? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip.\"

**Important**: This command works without external documents. They enhance output quality but are never blocking.

- All critical evidence found for this phase
- Evidence is comprehensive and high quality
- No significant gaps
- Team ready to discuss this point confidently

**🟡 Amber (Partial)**:
- Some evidence found but gaps remain
- Evidence exists but may lack detail or breadth
- Minor gaps that can be addressed quickly (1-2 weeks)
- Would likely receive \"Amber\" rating from assessment panel

**🔴 Red (Not Ready)**:
- Critical evidence missing
- Significant gaps that require substantial work (3+ weeks)
- Would likely receive \"Red\" rating and fail this point
- Must be addressed before booking assessment

**Overall Readiness Rating**:
- **🟢 Green (Ready)**: 12+ points Green, max 2 Amber, 0 Red
- **🟡 Amber (Nearly Ready)**: 10+ points Green/Amber, max 2 Red
- **🔴 Red (Not Ready)**: More than 2 Red points or fewer than 10 Green/Amber

### Step 6: Generate Recommendations

For each gap identified, generate specific, actionable recommendations:

**Priority Levels**:
- **Critical**: Must complete before assessment (affects Red rating)
- **High**: Should complete before assessment (affects Amber rating)
- **Medium**: Nice to have, strengthens case (improves confidence)

**Recommendation Format**:
```
Priority: [Critical/High/Medium]
Point: [Service Standard point number]
Action: [Specific action to take]
Timeline: [Estimated time to complete]
Who: [Suggested role/person]
Evidence to create: [What artifact/documentation will this produce]
```

### Step 7: Generate Assessment Day Guidance

Provide practical guidance for the assessment day:

**Documentation to Prepare** (share with panel 1 week before):
- List specific ArcKit artifacts to share
- Suggest additional materials needed (prototypes, demos, research findings)
- Recommend format for sharing (links, documents, slide deck limits)

**Who Should Attend**:
- Core team members required (Product Manager, User Researcher, Tech Lead, Delivery Manager)
- Phase-specific additions (e.g., Accessibility specialist for beta)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Over-prepare presentations (panel wants to see artifacts)
- ❌ Hide problems or pretend everything is perfect
- ❌ Use jargon or assume panel knows your context
- ❌ Let senior leaders dominate (panel wants to hear from doers)
- ❌ Argue with panel feedback
- ❌ Rush through - panel will interrupt with questions

**Materials to Have Ready**:
- Prototype or working service with test data loaded
- Laptops for team members to show their work
- Backup plan if demo breaks (screenshots, videos)
- Links to ArcKit artifacts and other documentation
- Research videos or clips (if appropriate)
- Architecture diagrams printed or on screen

*Good luck with your assessment! Remember: assessments are conversations about your service, not exams. Show your work, explain your thinking, and be open to feedback. The panel wants you to succeed.* 🚀
```

## Operating Constraints

**Tone and Approach**:
- Supportive and constructive - you want the team to succeed
- Specific and actionable - avoid vague recommendations
- Realistic - don't overwhelm with too many actions
- Evidence-based - always reference specific artifacts and line numbers
- Phase-appropriate - adjust expectations based on alpha/beta/live

**Quality Standards**:
- Every gap must have a specific recommendation
- Every recommendation must have an owner, timeline, and outcome
- RAG ratings must be justified with evidence (or lack thereof)
- Assessment day guidance must be practical and specific
- Report must be comprehensive but scannable

**Important Notes**:
- This is a **preparation tool**, not the actual assessment
- Panel will make final decisions based on their expert judgment
- This command helps teams gather evidence and present it effectively
- Re-run weekly to track progress as evidence is gathered
- Assessment outcomes can't be guaranteed, but preparation increases success rate significantly

## Example Usage

```
/arckit.service-assessment PHASE=alpha DATE=2025-12-15

```
/arckit.service-assessment PHASE=beta
```

Generates: `projects/002-payment-gateway/ARC-002-SVCASS-v1.0.md`

## Success Indicators

**This command succeeds when**:
- Team feels confident and prepared for assessment
- All 14 Service Standard points have clear evidence or action plans
- Critical gaps identified and addressed before booking
- Team can present their work clearly on assessment day
- Assessment preparation time reduced from weeks to days
- Higher pass rates for teams using this tool
