# UK Smart Meter Data Consumer Mobile App

**Architecture governance project for a mobile application enabling citizens to access and visualise their smart meter energy consumption data.**

Built with [ArcKit](https://tractorjuice.github.io/arc-kit/) -- 43 AI-driven slash commands for architecture governance across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI.

## Project Context

The **Smart Metering Implementation Programme (SMIP)** has deployed over 34 million smart meters across Great Britain. The **Data Communications Company (DCC)** operates the communications infrastructure connecting smart meters to energy suppliers and authorised third parties.

This project designs a consumer-facing mobile application that:

- **Authenticates** consumers and links to their smart meter(s)
- **Retrieves** half-hourly gas and electricity consumption data from SMETS1 and SMETS2 meters
- **Visualises** real-time and historical energy usage with intuitive charts and dashboards
- **Recommends** personalised energy-saving actions based on consumption patterns
- **Compares** tariffs using actual consumption data to help consumers switch
- **Alerts** consumers to unusual consumption, budget thresholds, and prepayment reminders

## Key Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) | Smart metering policy |
| Ofgem | Energy regulation, consumer data access rights |
| Data Communications Company (DCC) | Smart meter communications infrastructure |
| Energy Suppliers | Data providers, consumer relationship owners |
| Citizens / Energy Consumers | App users seeking to understand and reduce energy costs |
| Smart Energy GB | Consumer engagement and awareness |
| ICO | Data protection for personal energy consumption data |

## Regulatory Context

- **Smart Energy Code (SEC)** - Governs data access and security for smart metering
- **Ofgem Supplier Licence Conditions** - Consumer rights to access their energy data
- **UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018** - Energy consumption is personal data
- **Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)** - Electronic communications
- **GDS Service Standard** - 14-point assessment for government digital services
- **Technology Code of Practice (TCoP)** - 13-point UK Government technology standards
- **Accessibility Regulations (Public Sector Bodies) 2018** - Mobile accessibility

## Getting Started

1. Start your AI assistant (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Codex CLI)
2. Run `/arckit.principles` to establish architecture governance
3. Run `/arckit.stakeholders` to analyze stakeholder drivers and goals
4. Run `/arckit.requirements` to define requirements for the smart meter app

Full dependency ordering is documented in [`DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md`](DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md).
