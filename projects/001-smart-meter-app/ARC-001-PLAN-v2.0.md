## Executive Summary

**Project**: UK Smart Meter Data Consumer Mobile App
**Duration**: 18 months (78 weeks) — Discovery to Live
**Budget**: £10-17M (capital) + £5-9M/year (operating) — per ARC-001-REQ-v1.0
**Team**: 8-12 FTE (Discovery/Alpha), 20-30 FTE (Beta), 10-15 FTE (Live)
**Delivery Model**: GDS Agile Delivery (Discovery → Alpha → Beta → Live)

**Objective**: Deliver a cross-platform mobile application enabling 34 million smart meter households to access their half-hourly energy consumption data, receive personalised savings recommendations, and compare tariffs — achieving 5 million monthly active users within 18 months of public launch.

**Success Criteria**:
- 5 million MAU by Month 18 post-public launch (Goal G-1)
- 5% average energy reduction for active users (Goal G-2)
- All regulatory sign-offs (ICO, Ofgem, NCSC, GDS) before processing real consumer data (Goal G-3)
- DCC + 6 supplier integrations at Beta with >95% data retrieval success (Goal G-4)
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with 20+ accessibility user tests (Goal G-5)
- BCR > 2.0 validated by Month 24 post-launch (Goal G-6)

**Key Milestones**:
- Discovery Complete: Week 10
- Alpha Assessment (GDS): Week 22
- HLD Review: Week 20
- Private Beta Launch (real data): Week 40
- Public Beta Launch (all consumers): Week 52
- Live Assessment (GDS): Week 64
- 5M Users Target: Week 78 + 78 weeks post-public Beta = ~2028-12

**Project Complexity**: LARGE — 100+ requirements, 5+ external integrations, multiple compliance regimes (UK GDPR, SEC, Ofgem, GDS, NCSC, WCAG 2.2), 12 stakeholders with complex driver landscape, 20 identified risks including 5 exceeding appetite.

## Timeline Estimates

### Duration by Phase

| Phase | Start | End | Duration | Key Dependency |
|-------|-------|-----|----------|----------------|
| Discovery | Week 1 (2026-03-02) | Week 10 (2026-05-08) | 10 weeks | Team mobilisation |
| Alpha | Week 11 (2026-05-11) | Week 22 (2026-07-31) | 12 weeks | Discovery assessment pass |
| Beta | Week 23 (2026-08-03) | Week 64 (2027-05-14) | 42 weeks | Alpha assessment pass |
| Live | Week 65 (2027-05-17) | Week 78+ (ongoing) | 14+ weeks | Beta assessment pass |
| **Total Discovery to Live** | | | **78 weeks (~18 months)** | |

### Critical Path

The critical path runs through:

1. **Discovery → Alpha Assessment** (10 weeks) — Blocked by: user research, technology POCs
2. **Alpha → HLD Review → Alpha Assessment** (12 weeks) — Blocked by: architecture design, ICO engagement
3. **Alpha Assessment → DLD Review** (4 weeks) — Blocked by: HLD approval
4. **DLD Review → Sprint 6 completion** (18 weeks) — Blocked by: sprint delivery
5. **Regulatory sign-offs** (parallel, but hard gate for Private Beta) — Blocked by: ICO, Ofgem, NCSC capacity
6. **Private Beta → Public Beta → Beta Assessment** (16 weeks) — Blocked by: operational maturity
7. **Beta Assessment → Live** (7 weeks) — Blocked by: GDS assessment pass

**Critical path duration**: 67 weeks (allowing for parallel activities within phases)

**Highest risk items on critical path**:
- **ICO DPIA review** (R-010): ICO capacity may extend timeline — mitigate with early engagement in Alpha
- **DCC integration** (R-004): SEC process is lengthy — mitigate with n3rgy as interim route
- **Supplier API readiness** (R-003): 6 suppliers needed at Beta — mitigate with willing suppliers first

## Risk and Assumptions

### Key Risks Affecting the Plan

| Risk ID | Description | Plan Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| R-006 | Political/MoG change (Residual 16) | Programme cancelled or defunded | Demonstrate value at each gate; cross-party framing |
| R-002 | Consumer data breach (Residual 15) | Programme halted, trust destroyed | Security by Design, pen testing, NCSC review |
| R-010 | UK GDPR non-compliance (Residual 12) | Cannot process real data | Early DPIA, ICO pre-consultation |
| R-004 | DCC integration delays (Residual 6) | Beta delayed 2-4 months | n3rgy as interim; SEC application in Week 11 |
| R-003 | Supplier non-cooperation (Residual 9) | <80% coverage at Beta | Ofgem mandate; launch with willing suppliers |
| R-001 | Low consumer adoption (Residual 9) | BCR not achieved | Smart Energy GB co-marketing; simple onboarding |

### Key Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Impact if Wrong | Validation |
|----|-----------|----------------|------------|
| A-1 | DCC will provide API access within programme timeline | SMETS2 data unavailable — n3rgy as fallback | Alpha: SEC application, DCC engagement |
| A-2 | 6 major suppliers deliver APIs by Beta | Coverage below 80% target | Alpha: supplier forum, Ofgem reinforcement |
| A-3 | GOV.UK One Login supports mobile apps | Must deploy Keycloak (£264K, 4-week delay) | Discovery: One Login team engagement (Week 1) |
| A-4 | Smart Energy GB co-promotes at no cost | Marketing budget must increase | Discovery: co-marketing MoU |
| A-5 | Ofgem-endorsed tariff data source exists | Tariff comparison feature delayed | Alpha: Switchcraft evaluation, Ofgem engagement |
| A-6 | ICO capacity allows DPIA review within 6 weeks | Beta delayed by regulatory gate | Alpha: early ICO pre-consultation |

### Contingency

- **2 weeks buffer** built into each phase transition
- **DCC fallback**: If DCC direct integration delayed, n3rgy provides nationwide coverage
- **Authentication fallback**: If GOV.UK One Login unsuitable, Keycloak deployable in 4 weeks
- **Tariff data fallback**: Octopus and n3rgy both provide tariff data; build custom aggregation if no commercial source
