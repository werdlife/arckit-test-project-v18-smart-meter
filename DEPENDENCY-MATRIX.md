# ArcKit Command Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM)

This matrix shows which commands depend on outputs from other commands.

**Legend:**
- **M** = MANDATORY dependency (command will fail without it)
- **R** = RECOMMENDED dependency (command works better with it)
- **O** = OPTIONAL dependency (command can use if available)
- **Empty** = No dependency

**Reading the Matrix:**
- **Rows** = Commands that produce outputs
- **Columns** = Commands that consume those outputs
- Example: If row "principles" has "R" in column "stakeholders", it means stakeholders RECOMMENDS having principles first

## Critical Paths

### Standard Project Path (Non-AI, Non-Government)
```
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → research → wardley →
sow/evaluate → hld-review → backlog → servicenow → devops → operationalize →
traceability → principles-compliance → analyze → story
```

### UK Government Project Path
```
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → data-model → research →
wardley → gcloud-search → gcloud-clarify → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review →
backlog → servicenow → devops → operationalize → traceability →
tcop → secure → principles-compliance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### UK Government Platform Strategy Path
```
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → platform-design → data-model → research →
wardley → gcloud-search → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → secure → principles-compliance →
analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### UK Government AI Project Path
```
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → data-model → research →
wardley → gcloud-search → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → mlops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → ai-playbook → atrs → secure →
principles-compliance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### MOD Defence Project Path
```
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → data-model → research →
wardley → dos → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → mod-secure → principles-compliance →
analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### MOD Defence AI Project Path
```
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → data-model → research →
wardley → dos → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → mlops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → mod-secure → jsp-936 →
principles-compliance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

**Note**: analyze and service-assessment can also run earlier in the workflow to identify gaps in missing artifacts (all their dependencies are optional). The story command can be run at any project milestone to create a narrative snapshot, but is most comprehensive when run after all artifacts are complete. The paths above show the complete workflow with story as the final reporting step.

**Platform Design**: The platform-design command is used when designing multi-sided platforms (Government as a Platform, marketplaces, data platforms) and should be inserted after requirements definition but before detailed design. See "UK Government Platform Strategy Path" above.

**HLD** (external document) - consumed by 7 commands:
- dld-review (M), backlog (M), diagram (R), servicenow (R), traceability (M), hld-review (validates it), service-assessment (M)
  - Note: analyze reads HLD directly if available (O), not via hld-review

**ARC-*-PLAT-*.md** - consumed by 6 commands:
- research (R), wardley (R), diagram (R), analyze (M), principles-compliance (R), service-assessment (R)

### Commands That Produce Critical Artifacts (High Fan-Out)

**requirements** produces ARC-*-REQ-*.md → consumed by 36 commands (highest)
**principles** produces ARC-000-PRIN-v*.md → consumed by 20 commands
**stakeholders** produces ARC-*-STKE-*.md → consumed by 20 commands
**HLD** (external) → consumed by 7 commands
**risk** produces ARC-*-RISK-*.md → consumed by 6 commands
**platform-design** produces ARC-*-PLAT-v*.md → consumed by 6 commands

---

## Design Notes

1. **ARC-*-REQ-*.md is the central artifact** - Nearly all downstream commands depend on it
2. **ARC-000-PRIN-v*.md is the governance foundation** - All design reviews check against principles
3. **Strategic order matters** - stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements ensures business justification before technical work
4. **Platform strategy bridges business and technical** - platform-design sits between requirements (business needs) and design (technical architecture), useful for ecosystem-based platforms
5. **Quality gates can run iteratively** - analyze and service-assessment have optional dependencies, allowing them to run early (identifying gaps) or late (validating completeness)
6. **Compliance assessments feed quality gates** - tcop, ai-playbook, atrs, secure, mod-secure, jsp-936 outputs are optionally consumed by analyze and service-assessment
7. **External artifacts** - HLD and DLD are created outside ArcKit but validated by hld-review/dld-review commands
