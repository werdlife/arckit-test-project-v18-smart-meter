## Step 1b: Check for External Documents (optional)

Scan for external (non-ArcKit) documents the user may have provided:

**MOD AI Assurance Reports & DSTL Guidance**:
- **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/`
- **File types**: PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), Markdown (.md)
- **What to extract**: AI assurance evidence, DSTL guidance documents, test and evaluation results, safety case evidence
- **Examples**: `ai-assurance-report.pdf`, `dstl-guidance.pdf`, `safety-case.docx`

**MOD AI Policies**:
- **Look in**: `projects/000-global/policies/`
- **File types**: PDF, Word, Markdown
- **What to extract**: MOD AI strategy, defence AI ethical principles, JSP 936 compliance requirements
- **Examples**: `mod-ai-strategy.pdf`, `defence-ai-ethics.docx`

**User prompt**: If no external MOD AI docs found, ask:
"Do you have any MOD AI assurance reports, DSTL guidance, or safety case documentation? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

**Important**: This command works without external documents. They enhance output quality but are never blocking.

```

---

## Step 3: AI Ethical Risk Classification

For **each AI component**, perform ethical risk assessment using JSP 936's **likelihood × impact matrix**.

### Impact Assessment (Scale: 1-5)

**Consider impact on**:
- Human safety and wellbeing
- Operational effectiveness
- Legal and ethical compliance
- Public trust and reputation
- International obligations

**Impact Levels**:
2. **Insignificant**: Minimal impact, easily recovered
3. **Minor**: Limited impact, manageable within existing processes
4. **Moderate**: Noticeable impact, requires management attention
5. **Major**: Severe impact, significant consequences
6. **Catastrophic**: Extreme impact, loss of life or mission failure

### Likelihood Assessment (Scale: 1-5)

**Consider**:
- Technology maturity (TRL)
- Data quality and availability
- Algorithm complexity
- Operational environment
- Human factors and training

**Likelihood Levels**:
2. **Rare**: May occur only in exceptional circumstances (<10%)
3. **Unlikely**: Could occur but not expected (10-30%)
4. **Possible**: Might occur at some time (30-50%)
5. **Likely**: Will probably occur (50-80%)
6. **Almost Certain**: Expected to occur (>80%)

### Risk Matrix

Calculate: **Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**

| Score  | Classification | Approval Pathway            |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 20-25  | **Critical**   | 2PUS or Ministers           |
| 15-19  | **Severe**     | Defence-Level (JROC/IAC)    |
| 10-14  | **Major**      | Defence-Level (JROC/IAC)    |
| 5-9    | **Moderate**   | TLB-Level (delegated)       |
| 1-4    | **Minor**      | TLB-Level (delegated)       |

### Unacceptable Risk Criteria

**STOP IMMEDIATELY** if:
- Significant negative impacts are imminent
- Severe harms are occurring
- Catastrophic risks present
- System behaving outside acceptable bounds

**Example Output**:
```markdown
### Risk Assessment: Threat Detection Model

**Impact Analysis** (Score: 4 - Major):
- False negative (missed threat): Could lead to security breach, potential casualties
- False positive: Resources diverted, operational disruption
- Bias in detection: Discrimination concerns, legal implications
- Autonomy level: Human-in-loop but time-critical decisions

**Likelihood Analysis** (Score: 3 - Possible):
- Technology maturity: TRL 7 (system demonstrated in operational environment)
- Data quality: Good but potential bias in training set (limited diversity)
- Complexity: High - deep learning model with 20M parameters
- Environmental variance: Moderate - different weather/lighting conditions

**Risk Score**: 4 × 3 = 12

**Classification**: **MAJOR**

**Approval Pathway**: Defence-Level Oversight (JROC/IAC)

**Rationale**: While technology is mature, the high-impact nature of threat detection combined with possibility of errors due to environmental variance and potential data bias warrants Defence-level scrutiny.
```

## Step 4: Map to Five Ethical Principles

For **each AI component**, comprehensively address all 5 JSP 936 ethical principles.

### Principle 1: Human-Centricity

**Requirement**: "Assess and consider the impact of AI on humans, ensuring positive effects outweigh negatives."

**Document**:
2. **Human Impact Analysis**
   - Who is affected? (operators, civilians, decision-makers)
   - Positive effects (efficiency, safety, capability)
   - Negative effects (job displacement, stress, errors)
   - Net assessment

3. **Human-AI Interaction Design**
   - Interface design for operators
   - Cognitive load considerations
   - Trust calibration
   - Error recovery

4. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - User consultation process
   - Feedback mechanisms
   - Continuous improvement based on human experience

**Example**:
```markdown
#### Human-Centricity: Threat Detection Model

**Affected Stakeholders**:
- Intelligence analysts (primary users)
- Military commanders (decision-makers)
- Potential targets of military action

**Positive Effects**:
- Reduced analyst workload (40% time saving)
- Faster threat identification (< 5 minutes vs 30 minutes manual)
- 24/7 monitoring capability
- Reduced analyst fatigue and error

**Negative Effects**:
- Potential deskilling of manual analysis
- Over-reliance on automation
- Stress from time-critical AI-flagged threats
- Accountability concerns if AI errors lead to consequences

**Net Assessment**: Positive effects outweigh negatives, provided:
- Analysts maintain manual analysis skills through training
- Clear protocols for AI-assisted vs manual analysis
- Explainability features build appropriate trust
- Accountability framework clearly defined

**Human-AI Interaction**:
- Dashboard displays confidence scores and uncertainty
- Analysts can query model reasoning (Grad-CAM heatmaps)
- One-click override capability
- Feedback loop for analyst corrections
```

### Principle 2: Responsibility

**Requirement**: "Ensure meaningful human control and clear accountability."

**Document**:
2. **Accountability Mapping**
   - Who is responsible for AI outcomes?
   - Role definitions (developer, operator, approver)
   - Chain of command for AI decisions
   - Incident response ownership

3. **Meaningful Human Control**
   - Human-in-loop: Human makes final decision
   - Human-on-loop: Human monitors and can intervene
   - Human-out-of-loop: Human sets parameters, reviews later
   - Justify level of autonomy

4. **Decision Authority**
   - What decisions can AI make autonomously?
   - What requires human approval?
   - Override mechanisms
   - Escalation procedures

**Example**:
```markdown
#### Responsibility: Threat Detection Model

**Accountability Structure**:
- **System Owner**: Defence Intelligence (DI), Head of Imagery Analysis
- **Algorithm Owner**: Defence Science & Technology Laboratory (Dstl), AI Research Lead
- **Operational Responsibility**: Intelligence Analyst on watch
- **Approval Authority**: Watch Commander (Major/equivalent)
- **RAISO**: TLB appointed Responsible AI Senior Officer

**Meaningful Human Control**: **Human-in-loop**
- AI flags potential threats with confidence scores
- Analyst reviews imagery and AI reasoning
- Analyst makes recommendation to Watch Commander
- Commander approves/rejects action based on AI + analyst input
- No autonomous action without human approval

**Decision Authority Matrix**:
| Decision | AI | Analyst | Commander |
|----------|-----|---------|-----------|
| Flag potential threat | Autonomous | Review | Notified |
| Classify threat type | Recommend | Confirm | Approve |
| Initiate response | N/A | Recommend | Authorise |
| Override AI | N/A | Yes | Yes |

**Rationale**: High-impact nature of threat detection requires human judgement. AI augments analyst capability but does not replace human accountability for consequences.
```

### Principle 3: Understanding

**Requirement**: "Relevant personnel must understand how AI systems function and interpret outputs."

**Document**:
2. **Explainability Requirements**
   - Model transparency
   - Output interpretability
   - Confidence/uncertainty quantification
   - Reasoning traces

```

### Principle 4: Bias and Harm Mitigation

**Requirement**: "Proactively identify and reduce unintended biases and negative consequences."

**Document**:
2. **Bias Assessment**
   - Training data representativeness
   - Protected characteristics
   - Performance disparities across groups
   - Fairness metrics

3. **Harm Identification**
   - Direct harms (physical, psychological)
   - Indirect harms (discrimination, unfairness)
   - Systemic harms (societal impact)
   - Unintended consequences

4. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Data diversification
   - Algorithmic fairness techniques
   - Human oversight and review
   - Continuous monitoring for bias

**Example**:
```markdown
#### Bias and Harm Mitigation: Threat Detection Model

**Training Data Bias Assessment**:
- **Geographic Bias**: 70% of training data from Middle East, 20% Europe, 10% Asia - may underperform in under-represented regions
- **Temporal Bias**: Data from 2018-2024 - may not recognise historical or novel threat patterns
- **Scenario Bias**: Primarily conflict zones - may overfit to specific terrain/context
- **Label Bias**: Human-labelled data may inherit analyst biases

**Performance Disparity Analysis**:
- Tested across 5 geographic regions: Performance variance 8-15%
- Tested across 4 terrain types: Urban (92% accuracy), Desert (88%), Forest (82%), Arctic (78%)
- Tested across 3 weather conditions: Clear (90%), Overcast (85%), Adverse (75%)

**Identified Harms**:
2. **False Negative (Missed Threat)**:
   - Harm: Security breach, potential casualties
   - Likelihood: Low but high-impact
   - Mitigation: Human analyst always reviews, multiple detection systems, regular model updates

3. **False Positive (False Alarm)**:
   - Harm: Wasted resources, operator fatigue, potential civilian harm if action taken
   - Likelihood: Moderate
   - Mitigation: High confidence threshold (0.8), analyst confirmation required, feedback loop

4. **Discrimination**:
   - Harm: Disproportionate surveillance or action against certain regions/groups
   - Likelihood: Possible due to training data bias
   - Mitigation: Geographic performance monitoring, diverse test sets, ethical review board

5. **Over-Trust in Automation**:
   - Harm: Reduced critical thinking, missed nuanced threats
   - Likelihood: Moderate over time
   - Mitigation: Training on limitations, mandatory manual analysis exercises, rotation of duties

**Mitigation Strategy**:
2. **Data Augmentation**: Actively collect training data from under-represented regions (target: 30% each for 3 major regions by 2026)
3. **Fairness Constraints**: Implement equalized odds constraint to reduce performance disparity <5% across regions
4. **Human Oversight**: Maintain human-in-loop for all high-confidence detections
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track performance by region/terrain/weather monthly, retrain if disparities emerge
6. **Red Teaming**: Quarterly adversarial testing to identify failure modes and biases
7. **Ethical Review**: Annual independent ethics review of deployment and outcomes
```

### Principle 5: Reliability

**Requirement**: "Demonstrate robust, secure performance across operational contexts."

**Document**:
2. **Performance Bounds**
   - Design domain (where system is valid)
   - Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
   - Operating conditions
   - Edge case behaviour

3. **Robustness**

   - Incident response

**Example**:
```markdown
#### Reliability: Threat Detection Model

**Design Domain**:

**Performance Metrics** (on independent test set):
- **Accuracy**: 89% overall
- **Precision**: 92% (of flagged threats, 92% are genuine)
- **Recall**: 86% (detects 86% of actual threats)
- **F1 Score**: 0.89
- **False Positive Rate**: 3% (acceptable operational threshold: <5%)
- **False Negative Rate**: 14% (acceptable operational threshold: <20%)

**Performance by Context**:
| Context | Accuracy | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Clear weather, optimal resolution | 93% | Design centre |
| Moderate cloud (<30%) | 88% | Acceptable |
| Heavy cloud (>50%) | 72% | **Outside design domain** |
| Night-time | 45% | **Outside design domain** |
| Novel threat type (not in training) | 65% | Graceful degradation |
| Camouflaged threat | 70% | Known limitation |

**Robustness Testing**:
2. **Adversarial Resilience**:
   - Tested against FGSM, PGD, C&W attacks
   - Adversarial accuracy: 78% (acceptable: >70%)
   - Defenses: Input sanitisation, adversarial training, ensemble methods

3. **Out-of-Distribution Detection**:
   - Uncertainty estimation flags images outside design domain
   - System alerts operator when confidence is unreliable
   - 95% detection rate for OOD images

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Under sub-optimal conditions, system reduces confidence scores appropriately
   - Alerts operator to degraded performance
   - Falls back to human-only analysis if uncertainty exceeds threshold

**Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**:
| Failure Mode | Effect | Severity | Likelihood | Detection | RPN | Mitigation |
|--------------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|-----|------------|
| Model misclassification | False negative/positive | High (8) | Low (3) | Moderate (5) | 120 | Human review, confidence thresholds |
| Input corruption | Incorrect output | Moderate (6) | Low (2) | High (2) | 24 | Input validation, checksums |
| Model drift | Degraded performance | High (7) | Moderate (4) | Low (6) | 168 | Performance monitoring, retraining schedule |
| Adversarial attack | Evasion/poisoning | Critical (9) | Very Low (1) | Moderate (5) | 45 | Input defenses, secure deployment |

**Security Measures**:
2. **Model Security**:
   - Model encrypted at rest and in transit
   - Access controls (need-to-know basis)
   - Model watermarking to detect theft
   - Regular security audits

3. **AI-Specific Threats**:
   - **Adversarial Examples**: Input preprocessing, adversarial training
   - **Data Poisoning**: Training data provenance and validation
   - **Model Extraction**: API rate limiting, output randomisation
   - **Model Inversion**: Differential privacy during training

4. **Secure Deployment**:
   - Isolated execution environment (air-gapped where possible)
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Audit logging of all AI decisions
   - Incident response plan for AI security events

**Reliability Assurance**:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking on live data
- **Drift Detection**: Statistical tests for distribution shift (weekly)
- **Retraining Schedule**: Quarterly retraining with new data
- **A/B Testing**: New models tested alongside current model before deployment
- **Rollback Capability**: Immediate rollback to previous model if performance degrades
```

**Failure Modes and Protections**:
2. **Model Failure** (crash, exception):
   - Protection: Try-catch, fallback to previous model version, alert ML Ops
   - Graceful degradation: Route to human-only analysis queue
3. **OOD Input** (outside design domain):
   - Protection: Uncertainty check flags OOD, reduces confidence to 0
   - Alert: Notify analyst "AI confidence low, manual analysis recommended"
4. **GPU Failure**:
   - Protection: Kubernetes auto-restart, failover to healthy node
   - Degradation: Increased latency (<10 min) until recovery
5. **High Load** (>100 images/hour):
   - Protection: Queueing with priority (e.g., real-time > batch)
   - Degradation: Increased latency, SLA 95% <5 min
6. **Data Corruption**:
   - Protection: Checksum validation, reject corrupted images
   - Alert: Log error, notify ingestion team

**Security Architecture**:
- **Threat Model**: Adversarial examples, data poisoning, model extraction, insider threat
- **Security Controls**:
  - Input validation and sanitisation
  - Adversarial training and input defenses

### Phase 4: Algorithm Design

**Objective**: Document algorithm decisions with verification methods.

**Documentation Required**:
- [ ] **Algorithm Selection**: Justification for chosen approach
- [ ] **Design Decisions**: Architecture, hyperparameters, trade-offs
- [ ] **Verification Methods**: How to validate algorithm correctness
- [ ] **Output Verification**: Sanity checks, plausibility tests
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling**: Boundary conditions, failure modes

**Assurance Activities**:

- Edge case identification

**Example**:
```markdown
#### Phase 4: Algorithm Design - Threat Detection Model

**Algorithm Selection**:
- **Approach**: Deep learning - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Specific Architecture**: ResNet-50 backbone + Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) + Detection head
- **Justification**:
  - CNNs excel at image pattern recognition (SOTA for object detection)
  - ResNet-50: Good balance of accuracy and inference speed
  - FPN: Multi-scale detection for various object sizes
  - Proven in similar applications (e.g., COCO dataset, 90% mAP)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Faster R-CNN: More accurate (92% mAP) but 3× slower inference (15 min/image) - rejected due to latency requirement
- YOLO: Faster (1 min/image) but lower accuracy (82% mAP) - rejected due to accuracy requirement
- Vision Transformer: State-of-art (94% mAP) but requires 10× more training data - rejected due to data availability

**Design Decisions**:
2. **Input Resolution**: 1024×1024 pixels
   - Trade-off: Higher resolution = better small object detection but slower inference
   - Decision: 1024×1024 meets <5 min latency while detecting objects >10 pixels

3. **Backbone Depth**: ResNet-50 (50 layers)
   - Trade-off: Deeper = more accurate but slower, more parameters
   - Decision: ResNet-50 is sweet spot (ResNet-101 only +2% accuracy for 50% more compute)

4. **Training Strategy**: Transfer learning + fine-tuning
   - Pre-train on ImageNet (general image features)
   - Fine-tune on MOD satellite imagery (domain-specific)
   - Rationale: Leverages general knowledge, reduces training data requirement

5. **Loss Function**: Focal Loss (for class imbalance) + IoU Loss (for bounding boxes)
   - Trade-off: Focal Loss handles imbalance but more complex
   - Decision: Dataset has 95% negative (no threat) : 5% positive (threat) - focal loss essential

6. **Confidence Threshold**: 0.8
   - Trade-off: Higher threshold = fewer false positives but more false negatives
   - Decision: 0.8 balances precision (92%) and recall (86%), acceptable to domain experts

**Hyperparameters**:
- Learning rate: 0.001 (with cosine decay)
- Batch size: 32
- Epochs: 100 (with early stopping)
- Optimiser: AdamW (weight decay 0.0001)
- Data augmentation: Random flip, rotate, brightness/contrast adjustment

**Verification Methods**:
2. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components (preprocessing, NMS, postprocessing)
3. **Integration Testing**: Test full pipeline end-to-end
4. **Gradient Checking**: Verify backpropagation implementation (numerical vs analytical gradients)
5. **Sanity Checks**:
   - Overfit to single image (should reach 100% accuracy) - verifies learning capability
   - Random initialisation should give ~50% accuracy (verifies not memorising labels)
   - Shuffle labels should give ~50% accuracy (verifies model learns signal not noise)

**Output Verification**:
- **Plausibility Checks**:
  - Bounding boxes must be within image bounds (0-1024 pixels)
  - Confidence must be 0-1
  - Number of detections <100 (sanity check - unlikely to have >100 threats in one image)
- **Consistency Checks**:
  - Similar images should produce similar detections (temporal consistency)
  - Slightly perturbed images (±1 pixel, ±1% brightness) should give same detections (robustness)

**Edge Case Handling**:
2. **Empty Image** (no threats): Should output empty detection list with low aggregate confidence
3. **Image with >10 threats**: Should detect all, but may degrade to 80% recall
4. **Cloudy Image** (>50% cloud): OOD detection should flag, reduce confidence to 0
5. **Night-time Image**: OOD detection should flag (outside design domain)
6. **Corrupted Image**: Input validation should reject, return error
7. **Adversarially Perturbed Image**: Should maintain >70% accuracy (adversarial training)

**Explainability Design**:
- **Method**: Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)
- **Process**:
  1. Compute gradients of predicted class w.r.t. final convolutional layer
  2. Weight feature maps by gradients
  3. Sum weighted feature maps, apply ReLU
  4. Upsample to input resolution, overlay on image
- **Output**: Heatmap showing which image regions contributed to detection
- **Validation**: Heatmaps should highlight actual threat (not background) - manual review of 100 samples

**Assurance Activities Completed**:
- ✅ Algorithm design review (18 Apr 2025): Peer review by 2 ML experts, approved
- ✅ Verification method validation (25 Apr 2025): All sanity checks passed
- ✅ Edge case identification (2 May 2025): Tested 6 edge cases, documented behaviour
- ✅ Explainability validation (9 May 2025): Manual review of 100 heatmaps, 95% correctly highlight threat

- Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) = 0.048 (good, <0.1)
- Interpretation: When model says 90% confident, it's correct 88-92% of time

**Reuse Considerations**:
- **Transferability**: Model trained on visible spectrum satellite imagery (0.5-2m resolution)
  - Can likely transfer to similar resolution/spectrum imagery
  - Would need retraining for: IR imagery, different resolution, aerial (drone) imagery
- **Limitations for Reuse**:
  - Geographically biased (Middle East), may need data augmentation for other regions
  - Threat types limited to vehicles/structures/equipment - new threat types need retraining
  - Not suitable for: real-time video, handheld imagery, commercial satellite data (different characteristics)
- **Recommendations for Reuse**:
  - If >30% out-of-distribution data: retrain on new data
  - If new threat types: add labelled examples (minimum 500 per type), fine-tune
  - If different domain (e.g., IR): consider new model, possibly transfer backbone

3. Analyst identifies and marks threats
4. Analyst reports to Watch Commander
5. Commander decides on action

**New Process** (AI-assisted):
1. Satellite imagery arrives via secure feed → **AI ingestion**
3. **AI processes image** (< 5 min) → detections, confidence, heatmaps
4. **Analyst reviews AI output** (10 min/image) → confirm/reject
4. Analyst reports to Watch Commander (AI output + analyst judgement)
5. Commander decides on action (AI-assisted intelligence)

**Integration Points**:
- **Data Feed**: AI ingests from existing satellite feed (no change to upstream)
- **Dashboard**: AI dashboard embedded in analyst workspace (same environment)
- **Reporting**: AI outputs included in standard intelligence report template

## Step 7: Human-AI Teaming Strategy

Document how humans and AI will work together effectively.

### Human-AI Teaming Principles

2. **Complementary Strengths**: AI handles high-volume, pattern-matching tasks; humans handle complex judgement, contextual understanding, ethical decisions

3. **Appropriate Reliance**: Users trust AI when appropriate, challenge when necessary (calibrated trust, not over-trust or under-trust)

4. **Explainable AI**: Users understand why AI made a decision (transparency builds trust and enables oversight)

5. **Human Authority**: Humans maintain decision-making authority, AI provides recommendations (human-in-loop, not human-out-of-loop)

6. **Continuous Learning**: Humans learn from AI (new patterns), AI learns from humans (corrections, edge cases)

### Human Factors Considerations

**Training Requirements**:
- AI literacy (what is AI, how does it work, limitations)
- System-specific training (how to use this AI, interpret outputs)
- Critical thinking (when to challenge AI, recognise failure modes)
- Ethical awareness (JSP 936 principles, responsibilities)

**Cognitive Load**:
- Dashboard design: intuitive, not cluttered
- Information prioritisation: most important info first (confidence, heatmap)
- Workflow integration: AI fits into existing process, minimal disruption
- Alert fatigue: avoid excessive alerts, prioritise genuine concerns

**Trust Calibration**:
- Accurate performance feedback (don't over-promise)
- Transparent about uncertainty and limitations
- Explainability features (show reasoning)
- Consistent performance (predictable behaviour builds trust)

### Operator Support

**Decision Support Features**:
- Confidence scores and uncertainty quantification
- Visual explanations (heatmaps, attention maps)
- Similar examples from training data
- Performance context (how accurate is AI in this scenario?)

**Override and Feedback**:
- Easy override mechanism (analyst can reject AI, add manual detection)
- Feedback loop (rejections logged, inform retraining)
- No penalty for challenging AI (encourage critical thinking)

**Escalation Procedures**:
- When AI is uncertain (high uncertainty, OOD), escalate to senior analyst
- When analyst is uncertain, escalate to Watch Commander
- When system fails, escalate to ML Ops team

### Example Human-AI Teaming Strategy

```markdown
## Human-AI Teaming Strategy: Threat Detection Model

**Teaming Model**: **Human-in-loop** - AI recommends, human decides

### Complementary Strengths

**AI Strengths** (leverage for efficiency):
- Fast processing (<5 min vs 30 min manual)
- 24/7 operation (tireless)
- Consistent pattern recognition (no fatigue)
- High-volume throughput (150 images/day)

**Human Strengths** (leverage for quality):
- Complex judgement (contextual understanding, nuance)
- Ethical reasoning (proportionality, necessity)
- Domain expertise (recognise novel threats, camouflage)
- Adaptability (handle unexpected scenarios)

**Division of Labor**:
- AI: Initial screening, flag potential threats, prioritise analyst workload
- Human: Review AI output, apply expertise, make final decision, report to Commander

### Training Programme (see Phase 7 for details)

**Tier 1: AI Literacy** (4 hours, all analysts):
- Build understanding of AI capabilities and limitations
- Establish realistic expectations (calibrate trust)

**Tier 2: System-Specific** (8 hours, operational analysts):
- Hands-on practice interpreting AI outputs
- Recognise failure modes (when AI struggles)
- Develop critical thinking (when to challenge AI)

**Tier 3: Refresher** (2 hours, quarterly):
- Keep knowledge current (model updates, new edge cases)
- Share best practices (lessons learned)

### Dashboard Design (cognitive load optimisation)

**Layout**:
- **Left Panel** (60% screen): Image with bounding boxes (primary focus)
- **Right Panel** (40% screen): AI insights (confidence, uncertainty, heatmap)
- **Bottom Bar**: Similar examples, model reasoning (secondary info)

**Information Hierarchy**:
2. **Most Important**: Bounding boxes on image (what AI detected)
3. **Second**: Confidence scores (how sure is AI?)
4. **Third**: Heatmap (why did AI detect this?)
5. **Fourth**: Similar examples (context for decision)

**Colour Coding** (quick visual cues):
- **Red bounding box**: High confidence (>0.8) - prioritise review
- **Yellow bounding box**: Medium confidence (0.5-0.8) - careful review
- **Grey bounding box**: Low confidence (<0.5) - likely false positive
- **Blue alert banner**: OOD or high uncertainty - manual analysis recommended

**Workflow Integration**:
- AI dashboard embedded in existing analyst workspace (same environment, no context switching)
- Existing reporting templates extended to include AI output (minimal change)
- Hotkeys for common actions (Accept: Enter, Reject: R, Override: O)

### Appropriate Reliance (trust calibration)

**Build Trust** (when AI is reliable):
- Transparent about performance: "89% accurate on similar images"
- Show reasoning: Heatmaps highlight what AI sees
- Consistent performance: AI doesn't have "off days"
- Success stories: Share cases where AI caught threats analysts missed

**Maintain Vigilance** (when AI might fail):
- Explicit about limitations: "AI struggles with camouflage, cloud cover, novel threats"
- Alert on uncertainty: "AI confidence low, manual analysis recommended"
- Encourage scepticism: "Always apply your expertise, challenge AI if something doesn't look right"
- Near-miss reporting: Share cases where AI was wrong, what analysts caught

**Calibration Feedback**:
- Monthly performance reports shared with analysts (accuracy, false positives/negatives)
- Quarterly user surveys: "Do you trust AI too much, too little, or about right?"
- Spot checks: Do analyst decisions align with AI appropriately?

### Decision Support Features (explainability)

**Confidence & Uncertainty**:
- **Confidence Score**: 0-1, what's the probability this is a threat?
- **Uncertainty**: Standard deviation from 10 forward passes (Bayesian dropout)
- **Interpretation**: "Confidence 0.9, Uncertainty 0.05 = AI is sure. Confidence 0.7, Uncertainty 0.3 = AI is guessing, be careful."

**Visual Explanations**:
- **Heatmap (Grad-CAM)**: Overlay on image, red = regions that influenced detection
- **Purpose**: Analysts can see "Is AI looking at the vehicle (good) or the shadow (bad)?"
- **Validation**: If heatmap highlights irrelevant region, analyst can reject detection

**Similar Examples**:
- Show 3 most similar images from training data
- Purpose: "Have we seen this before? Does this threat look like previous threats?"
- Helps analysts understand AI's reference frame

**Performance Context**:
- Display: "For images like this (desert, clear weather), AI is 92% accurate"
- Purpose: Analysts know when to trust AI more vs less
- Updates based on operational data

### Override and Feedback Mechanisms

**Override Actions**:
2. **Accept Detection**: Analyst confirms threat (Green checkmark button)
3. **Reject Detection**: Analyst rejects false positive (Red X button) - **must provide reason**
4. **Manual Detection**: Analyst adds threat AI missed (Draw bounding box) - **flagged for retraining**
5. **Uncertain**: Analyst unsure, escalate to senior analyst (Yellow ? button)

**Rejection Reasons** (dropdown):
- False positive (no threat present)
- Misclassification (threat is different type than AI said)
- Duplicate detection (AI flagged same threat twice)
- Outside design domain (e.g., cloudy image, AI unreliable)
- Other (free text)

**Feedback Loop** (continuous improvement):
- All rejections logged: image ID, AI output, analyst decision, reason
- Monthly review by ML Ops: Are there common failure modes? Do we need retraining?
- Manual detections (AI misses) prioritised for retraining dataset
- Feedback informs quarterly model updates

**No Penalty for Challenging AI**:
- Analyst performance evaluated on correct final decisions, not on agreement with AI
- Encourage critical thinking: "Your expertise is valuable, trust your judgement"
- Celebrate good catches: Monthly "Best AI Challenge" award for analyst who caught important AI error

### Escalation Procedures

**Escalation Triggers**:
2. **High Uncertainty**: Uncertainty >0.3 → AI alerts analyst "Low confidence, manual analysis recommended"
3. **OOD Input**: Image outside design domain → AI flags, analyst performs manual analysis
4. **Analyst Uncertain**: Analyst unsure about detection → escalate to senior analyst or Watch Commander
5. **System Failure**: AI unavailable → fall back to manual-only, notify ML Ops

**Escalation Process**:
- **Level 1**: AI uncertain → Analyst reviews manually
- **Level 2**: Analyst uncertain → Senior Analyst reviews
- **Level 3**: Senior Analyst uncertain → Watch Commander decides
- **Level 4**: System failure → ML Ops team investigates, System Owner notified

### Monitoring Team Effectiveness (human-AI performance)

**Metrics** (tracked monthly):
- **AI-Assisted Accuracy**: Are analyst+AI decisions correct? (Target: ≥95%)
- **Time Savings**: How much faster is analysis with AI? (Target: ≥40%)
- **Override Rate**: How often do analysts reject AI? (Baseline: ~8%, concerning if suddenly increases)
- **Miss Rate**: How often do analysts miss threats? (Target: <5%)
- **User Satisfaction**: Quarterly survey (Target: ≥4/5)

**Red Flags** (indicate teaming issues):
- Over-reliance: Analysts accepting AI without review (spot checks show superficial reviews)
- Under-trust: Analysts ignoring AI even when accurate (high rejection rate >20% but AI correct)
- Deskilling: Analysts struggling with manual analysis (performance drops in manual-only exercises)
- Cognitive overload: Analysts reporting dashboard confusing or overwhelming

**Corrective Actions**:
- Over-reliance: Refresher training on limitations, manual-only exercises (maintain skills)
- Under-trust: Calibration training, share AI successes, investigate if AI performance degraded
- Deskilling: Regular manual-only exercises, rotate duties (mix AI-assisted and manual days)
- Cognitive overload: Dashboard redesign, user testing, simplify information presentation

### Human-AI Teaming Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| AI-Assisted Accuracy | ≥95% | 96% | ✅ **EXCEEDS** |
| Time Savings | ≥40% | 45% | ✅ **EXCEEDS** |
| Override Rate (rejections) | 5-15% | 8% | ✅ **GOOD** |
| Miss Rate | <5% | 3% | ✅ **GOOD** |
| User Satisfaction | ≥4/5 | 4.2/5 | ✅ **GOOD** |

**Overall Human-AI Teaming**: **EFFECTIVE** - Complementary strengths leveraged, appropriate reliance, users satisfied
```

## Step 8: Secure by Design Evidence

Document security measures specific to AI systems.

### AI-Specific Threat Landscape

**Adversarial Threats**:
2. **Adversarial Examples**: Carefully crafted inputs that fool AI (e.g., add imperceptible noise to image, AI misclassifies)
3. **Data Poisoning**: Inject malicious data into training set (e.g., backdoor triggers)
4. **Model Evasion**: Adversary crafts inputs to avoid detection
5. **Model Extraction**: Steal model via API queries
6. **Model Inversion**: Reconstruct training data from model

**Operational Threats**:
7. **Model Drift**: Performance degrades as data distribution shifts
8. **Insider Threat**: Malicious insider modifies model or data
9. **Supply Chain**: Compromised third-party components (libraries, pre-trained models)

### Security Controls for AI

**Input Validation & Sanitisation**:
- Validate image format, resolution, metadata
- Reject malformed or suspicious inputs
- Input preprocessing (normalisation, resize) can mitigate some adversarial examples

**Adversarial Defenses**:
- **Adversarial Training**: Train model on adversarial examples (improves robustness)
- **Input Transformation**: Random resize, JPEG compression, bit depth reduction
- **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple models, vote on output (harder to fool all)
- **Certified Defenses**: Provable robustness bounds (research area, not yet operational)

**Model Security**:
- **Encryption**: Encrypt model at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Access Controls**: Restrict model access (need-to-know, SC clearance minimum)
- **Model Watermarking**: Embed unique identifier (detect model theft)
- **Output Randomisation**: Add noise to API outputs (prevent model extraction)

**Data Security**:
- **Data Provenance**: Verify all training data sources, chain of custody
- **Data Validation**: Check for anomalies, statistical tests for poisoning
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypt data, access logs, secure deletion
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise during training (prevent model inversion)

**Monitoring & Detection**:
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detect drift (performance drops may indicate attack)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual inputs or outputs (potential adversarial examples)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logs for forensics
- **Incident Response**: Plan for AI security incidents

### Example Secure by Design Documentation

```markdown
## Secure by Design: Threat Detection Model

### Threat Model (STRIDE Analysis)

| Threat | Example | Likelihood | Impact | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | Adversary impersonates legitimate user | Low | Major | Moderate | Authentication (SC clearance), access logs |
| **Tampering** | Adversary modifies model or data | Very Low | Critical | Moderate | Encryption, access controls, integrity checks |
| **Repudiation** | User denies action | Low | Minor | Low | Audit logging (all actions logged) |
| **Information Disclosure** | Adversary steals model or data | Low | Critical | Moderate | Encryption, access controls, output randomisation |
| **Denial of Service** | Adversary overwhelms system | Very Low | Moderate | Low | Rate limiting, redundancy, DDoS protection |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Adversary gains unauthorised access | Very Low | Critical | Moderate | Principle of least privilege, RBAC |
| **Adversarial Examples** (AI-specific) | Adversary crafts input to fool model | Possible | Major | **High** | **Adversarial training, input defenses** |
| **Data Poisoning** (AI-specific) | Adversary injects malicious training data | Rare | Critical | Moderate | Data provenance verification, validation |
| **Model Extraction** (AI-specific) | Adversary steals model via API | Possible | Major | **High** | **Output randomisation, rate limiting** |
| **Model Inversion** (AI-specific) | Adversary reconstructs training data | Rare | Major | Moderate | Differential privacy |

**Highest Risks**: Adversarial Examples, Model Extraction - prioritise mitigations

### AI-Specific Security Controls

**1. Adversarial Robustness**

**Defense: Adversarial Training**
- **Method**: Augment training data with adversarial examples (FGSM, PGD)
- **Implementation**: 20% of training batches are adversarial examples
- **Result**: Adversarial accuracy 78% (baseline 89%) - 11% drop, acceptable (target ≥70%)

**Defense: Input Transformation**
- **Method**: Random resize (±10%), JPEG compression (quality 85-95%), bit depth reduction (8-bit)
- **Purpose**: Disrupt adversarial perturbations while preserving legitimate image features
- **Result**: Combined with adversarial training, achieves 78% adversarial accuracy

**Defense: Ensemble Methods**
- **Method**: 3 models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet), vote on output
- **Purpose**: Harder to craft adversarial example that fools all 3 models
- **Result**: Ensemble adversarial accuracy 82% (4% improvement over single model)
- **Trade-off**: 3× inference time (15 min) - **not used operationally due to latency**, but available for high-priority images

**Testing: Adversarial Robustness**
- **Methods Tested**: FGSM, PGD, C&W (see Phase 6)
- **Results**: 78% accuracy (≥70% target) - **PASS**

**2. Data Poisoning Prevention**

**Defense: Data Provenance Verification**
- **Process**: All 50,000 training images traced to MOD Satellite Archive
- **Chain of Custody**: Documented from satellite → archive → extraction → labelling
- **No External Data**: Zero commercially sourced or open-source data (contamination risk)
- **Result**: Provenance 100% verified (see Phase 8)

**Defense: Data Validation**
- **Statistical Tests**: Check for distribution anomalies (outliers, unusual patterns)
- **Labelling Consistency**: Inter-rater agreement κ=0.87 (good), disputed images adjudicated
- **Backdoor Testing**: Test model on trigger patterns (e.g., specific image patch) - no backdoors detected
- **Result**: No evidence of data poisoning

**3. Model Extraction Prevention**

**Defense: Output Randomisation**
- **Method**: Add noise to confidence scores (±0.02 uniform noise)
- **Purpose**: Each query returns slightly different output (model extraction requires consistent outputs)
- **Result**: 10,000 queries insufficient to replicate model (tested by security team)
- **Trade-off**: Minimal impact on analyst use (noise negligible for decision-making)

**Defense: Rate Limiting**
- **Method**: Max 100 queries/user/hour, 1,000 queries/user/day
- **Purpose**: Prevent adversary from making millions of queries needed for model extraction
- **Result**: Legitimate users average 50 queries/day, limit not restrictive

**Defense: API Access Logging**
- **Method**: Log all API queries (user, timestamp, image ID, output)
- **Purpose**: Detect anomalous query patterns (e.g., automated scraping)
- **Result**: Logs reviewed weekly, no suspicious patterns detected

**4. Model Inversion Prevention**

**Defense: Differential Privacy**
- **Method**: Add noise during training (ε=8 differential privacy)
- **Purpose**: Prevent adversary from reconstructing individual training images from model
- **Result**: Model inversion attacks fail to reconstruct recognisable images
- **Trade-off**: Minimal accuracy drop (0.5%) - acceptable

**5. Model Security (Confidentiality & Integrity)**

**Defense: Model Encryption**
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption, key managed by MOD key management service
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all model transfers (training → deployment, deployment → inference)
- **Result**: Penetration testing confirms no unencrypted model access

**Defense: Access Controls**
- **Authentication**: SC clearance minimum for all users
- **Authorisation**: RBAC - analysts (inference only), ML Ops (inference + update), system owner (full access)
- **Result**: Principle of least privilege enforced

**Defense: Model Watermarking**
- **Method**: Embed unique identifier in model weights (imperceptible, survives fine-tuning)
- **Purpose**: If model is stolen, watermark can prove ownership
- **Result**: Watermark detected with 99% confidence after testing

**6. Secure Deployment**

**Defense: Isolated Execution**
- **Method**: Kubernetes cluster in MOD secure cloud (SECRET environment), air-gapped where possible
- **Network Isolation**: Firewall rules, no internet access, VPN-only access
- **Result**: Penetration testing confirms no external network access

**Defense: Principle of Least Privilege**
- **Containers**: Run as non-root user, minimal privileges
- **Secrets**: Stored in Kubernetes secrets, not in code or config files
- **Result**: Security audit confirms least privilege enforced

**Defense: Vulnerability Management**
- **Scanning**: Weekly vulnerability scans of containers, dependencies, OS
- **Patching**: Critical vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours, high within 7 days
- **Result**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, 2 minor (patched)

**7. Monitoring & Incident Response**

**Defense: Performance Monitoring**
- **Purpose**: Sudden performance drop may indicate adversarial attack or drift
- **Metrics**: Daily accuracy, false positive/negative rates
- **Alerts**: Performance drop >5% triggers ML Ops alert
- **Result**: Continuous monitoring dashboard operational (see Phase 7)

**Defense: Anomaly Detection**
- **Purpose**: Flag unusual inputs or outputs (potential adversarial examples)
- **Method**: OOD detection (uncertainty >0.3, flags 95% of OOD images)
- **Result**: OOD inputs flagged, routed to manual analysis

**Defense: Audit Logging**
- **Comprehensive Logs**: All inputs, outputs, users, timestamps, decisions
- **Storage**: Encrypted, 7-year retention, tamper-proof
- **Purpose**: Forensics if security incident occurs
- **Result**: 100% logging coverage (see Phase 8)

**Defense: Incident Response Plan**
- **AI-Specific Incidents**: Adversarial attack, data poisoning, model drift, model theft
- **Response Team**: ML Ops (24/7 on-call), Security Team, System Owner, RAISO
- **Procedure**: Detect → Triage → Contain → Investigate → Remediate → Post-Mortem
- **Result**: Incident response plan tested (tabletop exercise, 15 Oct 2025), approved

### Security Testing Results

## Step 10: Continuous Monitoring & Re-Assessment Plan

Document how AI system will be monitored and re-assessed throughout its operational life.

### Continuous Monitoring

**Real-Time Monitoring** (automated, dashboard):
- Performance metrics (accuracy, latency, availability)
- Drift detection (distribution shift, performance degradation)
- Security events (anomalous inputs, access violations)
- Operational metrics (throughput, user feedback)

**Periodic Monitoring** (manual, reports):
- Weekly: Performance by subgroup (region, terrain, weather)
- Monthly: Comprehensive performance report, bias analysis, feedback analysis
- Quarterly: Strategic review, user satisfaction, model card update
- Annual: Full JSP 936 compliance review, ethics review, security audit

### Drift Detection & Retraining

**Types of Drift**:
2. **Data Drift**: Input distribution changes (e.g., new geographic region, different satellite)
3. **Concept Drift**: Relationship between input and output changes (e.g., new threat types)
4. **Performance Drift**: Model accuracy degrades over time

**Detection Methods**:
- Statistical tests (KL divergence, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
- Performance monitoring (accuracy drop >5% from baseline)
- Analyst feedback (increased rejection rate, manual additions)

**Retraining Triggers**:
- **Automatic**: Performance drops >5% (accuracy <84%)
- **Scheduled**: Quarterly retraining with new operational data
- **On-Demand**: Significant data drift detected, new threat types emerge

**Retraining Process**:
1. Collect new operational data (labelled by analysts via feedback loop)
2. Re-assess training data (representativeness, bias)
3. Retrain model (fine-tune on new data)
4. Test new model (A/B testing against current model)
5. If new model better: deploy with rollback capability
6. If new model worse: investigate, adjust training, try again

### Re-Assessment & Re-Approval

**Annual JSP 936 Compliance Review**:
- Full lifecycle documentation reviewed
- Performance report (has accuracy maintained ≥85%?)
- Bias analysis (performance disparity still <10%?)
- Ethical compliance (5 principles still met?)
- Security audit (no new vulnerabilities?)
- Operational impact (time savings, user satisfaction)
- **Decision**: Continue use (with any mitigations) or retire system

**Trigger Events for Re-Approval** (outside annual review):
- Major model update (architecture change, significant retraining)
- Change in operational context (new mission, new risks)
- Major security incident (breach, adversarial attack)
- Ethical concerns (stakeholder complaints, ethics board concerns)
- Performance degradation >10% (unresolved after retraining)

**Re-Approval Process**:
- Submit updated JSP 936 documentation (changes since last approval)
- RAISO review and recommendation
- Approval authority (same as original: JROC for MAJOR risk)
- Decision: Continue, modify, or retire system

### System Retirement

**Retirement Criteria**:
- Performance consistently fails to meet requirements (<85% accuracy despite retraining)
- Unacceptable ethical risk (cannot be mitigated)
- Operational context changes (AI no longer needed or suitable)
- Superseded by better system

**Retirement Process**:
1. Decision to retire (System Owner, RAISO, approval authority)
2. Transition plan (fallback to alternative system or manual process)
3. Decommissioning (secure deletion of model and data)
4. Post-retirement review (lessons learned, documentation archival)

### Example Continuous Monitoring Plan

```markdown
## Continuous Monitoring & Re-Assessment: Threat Detection Model

### Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard (Grafana)

**Performance Panel** (updated every 1 hour):
- Accuracy (rolling 24-hour, 7-day)
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate
- **Alerts**: Accuracy <84% (red), <87% (yellow)

**Drift Panel** (updated daily):
- Input distribution (KL divergence vs training data)
- Performance by subgroup (region, terrain, weather)
- **Alerts**: KL divergence >0.1 (possible data drift), performance disparity >10% (possible bias drift)

**Security Panel** (real-time):
- Anomalous inputs (OOD rate, unusual patterns)
- Access violations (unauthorised access attempts)
- **Alerts**: OOD rate >10%, access violations >0

**Operational Panel** (updated hourly):
- Throughput (images processed/hour)
- Latency (processing time, 95th percentile)
- Availability (uptime %)
- User feedback (confirmations, rejections, manual additions)
- **Alerts**: Latency >5 min, availability <99%, rejection rate >20%

### Periodic Monitoring Reports

**Weekly Report** (generated Monday, emailed to ML Ops Lead):
- Performance by subgroup (region, terrain, weather)
- Edge cases encountered (OOD images, low confidence, unusual detections)
- Analyst feedback summary (rejections, manual additions)
- **Action Items**: Investigate any performance drop >3%, edge cases >5%

**Monthly Report** (generated 1st of month, reviewed by System Owner):
- Comprehensive performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, mAP)
- Bias analysis (performance across regions/terrain/weather)
- Drift analysis (KL divergence, performance trends)
- Feedback analysis (common rejection reasons, AI misses)
- User satisfaction (spot checks, informal surveys)
- **Decision**: Retraining needed? (Yes if performance <87% or significant drift)

**Quarterly Report** (generated end of quarter, reviewed by RAISO):
- Strategic review (operational impact, time savings, threat detection improvements)
- User satisfaction survey (formal, all 20 analysts)
- Ethical review (compliance with 5 principles, any concerns)
- Security review (incidents, vulnerabilities, threat landscape changes)
- Model card update (performance, limitations, changes since last quarter)
- **Decision**: Continue as-is, adjust, or escalate concerns

**Annual Report** (generated end of year, submitted to JROC):
- Full JSP 936 compliance review (27 requirements)
- Performance over 12 months (trends, degradation, improvements)
- Ethics review (independent ethics board report)
- Security audit (MOD Cyber Security Team report)
- Operational impact assessment (quantitative and qualitative benefits)
- **Decision**: Re-approve for another year, modify, or retire

### Drift Detection & Retraining

**Data Drift Detection**:
- **Method**: KL divergence between operational data distribution and training data distribution
- **Threshold**: KL divergence >0.1 triggers investigation
- **Current Status** (as of Oct 2025): KL divergence = 0.05 (acceptable)

**Concept Drift Detection**:
- **Method**: Performance degradation on operational data (accuracy, precision, recall)
- **Threshold**: Accuracy <87% triggers retraining (performance cushion before critical <85%)
- **Current Status**: Accuracy = 89.5% (stable)

**Performance Drift Detection**:
- **Method**: Rolling 7-day accuracy compared to baseline (89%)
- **Threshold**: Drop >5% (to <84%) triggers automatic retraining
- **Current Status**: 89.5% (no drift)

**Retraining Schedule**:
- **Quarterly Scheduled Retraining**: Every 3 months (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
- **Purpose**: Incorporate new operational data (labelled via analyst feedback), maintain performance
- **Process**:
  1. Collect operational data from past 3 months (~13,500 images)
  2. Analysts label new data (prioritise rejections and manual additions)
  3. Augment training set (35,000 original + 13,500 new = 48,500)
  4. Retrain model (fine-tune from current model, 20 epochs)
  5. A/B testing (new model vs current model on held-out validation set)
  6. Deploy if new model ≥current model performance, else investigate

**Last Retraining**: Oct 2025 (initial deployment)
**Next Scheduled Retraining**: Jan 2026

**On-Demand Retraining Triggers**:
- Accuracy drops <87% (retraining triggered immediately)
- Significant data drift (KL divergence >0.1)
- New threat type emerges (e.g., novel vehicle, not in training data)
- Geographic expansion (e.g., deploy to new region with <20% training data representation)

### Re-Assessment & Re-Approval
