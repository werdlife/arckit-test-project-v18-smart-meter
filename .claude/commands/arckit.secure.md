# UK Government Secure by Design Assessment

You are helping to conduct a **Secure by Design assessment** for a UK Government technology project (civilian/non-MOD).

## Context

UK Government departments must follow NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) guidance and achieve appropriate security certifications before deploying systems. This assessment evaluates security controls using the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF).

**Key UK Government Security References**:
- NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)
- Cyber Essentials / Cyber Essentials Plus
- UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018
- Government Security Classifications Policy
- Cloud Security Principles

## Your Task

Generate a comprehensive Secure by Design assessment document by:

1. **Loading the template**: Use the UK Gov Secure by Design template from `.arckit/templates/ukgov-secure-by-design-template.md`
   > **Note**: Read the `VERSION` file and update the version in the template metadata line when generating.

2. **Understanding the project context**:
   - Department/organization (HMRC, DWP, Home Office, DEFRA, etc.)
   - Data classification (PUBLIC, OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE)
   - Project phase (Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live)
   - User base (public-facing, internal staff, both)
   - Hosting approach (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)

3. **Read Available Documents**:

   Scan the project directory for existing artifacts and read them to inform this assessment:

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - `ARC-*-REQ-*.md` in `projects/{project-name}/` — Requirements specification
     - Extract: NFR-SEC (security), NFR-P (performance), NFR-A (availability), INT (integration), DR (data) requirements
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit.requirements` first
   - `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` in `projects/000-global/` — Architecture principles
     - Extract: Security standards, approved platforms, compliance requirements, cloud policy
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit.principles` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - `ARC-*-RISK-*.md` in `projects/{project-name}/` — Risk register
     - Extract: Security risks, threat model, risk appetite, mitigations
   - `ARC-*-DPIA-*.md` in `projects/{project-name}/` — Data Protection Impact Assessment
     - Extract: Personal data processing, lawful basis, data protection risks
   - `ARC-*-DIAG-*.md` in `projects/{project-name}/diagrams/` — Architecture diagrams
     - Extract: Deployment topology, network boundaries, data flows, integration points

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
   - `ARC-*-TCOP-*.md` in `projects/{project-name}/` — TCoP review
     - Extract: Technology governance compliance, Point 6 (Secure) findings
   - `ARC-*-AIPB-*.md` in `projects/{project-name}/` — AI Playbook assessment
     - Extract: AI-specific security requirements (prompt injection, data poisoning)
   - `ARC-*-ATRS-*.md` in `projects/{project-name}/` — ATRS record
     - Extract: Algorithmic transparency security requirements

   **What to extract from each document**:
   - **Principles**: Security standards, approved platforms, compliance constraints
   - **Requirements**: NFR-SEC IDs, data classification, availability targets, integration security
   - **Risk**: Security threats, risk levels, existing mitigations
   - **DPIA**: Personal data categories, lawful basis, data protection controls
   - **Diagrams**: Network topology, trust boundaries, data flow paths

4. **Check for External Documents** (optional):

   Scan for external (non-ArcKit) documents the user may have provided:

   **Security Assessment Reports**:
   - **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/`
   - **File types**: PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), Markdown (.md), Images (.png, .jpg)
   - **What to extract**: Vulnerability findings, risk ratings, remediation recommendations
   - **Examples**: `pentest-report.pdf`, `vulnerability-scan.pdf`, `red-team-findings.docx`

   **Compliance Certificates & Audit Reports**:
   - **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/` or `projects/000-global/policies/`
   - **File types**: PDF, images (certificate scans)
   - **What to extract**: Certification scope, validity dates, audit findings, non-conformities
   - **Examples**: `cyber-essentials-plus-cert.pdf`, `iso27001-audit.pdf`, `soc2-report.pdf`

   **Threat Models**:
   - **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/`
   - **File types**: Markdown, PDF, images (STRIDE/DREAD diagrams)
   - **What to extract**: Threat actors, attack vectors, existing mitigations, residual risks
   - **Examples**: `threat-model.md`, `stride-analysis.pdf`

   **Security Policies**:
   - **Look in**: `projects/000-global/policies/`
   - **File types**: PDF, Word, Markdown
   - **What to extract**: Security requirements, acceptable risk levels, mandatory controls
   - **Examples**: `security-policy.pdf`, `risk-appetite.md`, `incident-response-plan.docx`

   **User prompt**: If no external security docs found, ask:
   "Do you have any existing security assessments, pen test reports, or threat models? I can read PDFs and images directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

   **Important**: This command works without external documents. They enhance output quality but are never blocking.

5. **Assess security using NCSC CAF (14 principles across 4 objectives)**:

   **Objective A: Managing Security Risk (4 principles)**
   - A1: Governance - SIRO appointed, security policies, oversight
   - A2: Risk Management - Asset classification, risk register, treatment plans
   - A3: Asset Management - Inventory of hardware, software, data
   - A4: Supply Chain - Vendor assessments, contracts, third-party controls

   **Objective B: Protecting Against Cyber Attack (6 principles)**
   - B1: Service Protection Policies - Acceptable use, access control, data protection policies
   - B2: Identity and Access Control - MFA, PAM, least privilege, access reviews
   - B3: Data Security - Encryption, UK GDPR compliance, DPIA, DLP
   - B4: System Security - Patching, hardening, anti-malware, EDR
   - B5: Resilient Networks - Segmentation, firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPN
   - B6: Staff Awareness - Security training, phishing awareness, data protection

   **Objective C: Detecting Cyber Security Events (2 principles)**
   - C1: Security Monitoring - SIEM, alerting, logging, threat intelligence
   - C2: Proactive Security Event Discovery - Vulnerability scanning, pen testing, threat hunting

   **Objective D: Minimising the Impact of Incidents (2 principles)**
   - D1: Response and Recovery Planning - Incident response, BC/DR, RTO/RPO
   - D2: Improvements - Post-incident reviews, metrics, continuous improvement

6. **Assess Cyber Essentials compliance (5 controls)**:
   - Firewalls - Boundary firewalls configured
   - Secure Configuration - Hardened systems, unnecessary services disabled
   - Access Control - User accounts, MFA, least privilege
   - Malware Protection - Anti-malware on all devices
   - Patch Management - Timely patching (critical within 14 days)

7. **Assess UK GDPR compliance (if processing personal data)**:
   - DPO appointed (if required)
   - Lawful basis identified
   - Privacy notice published
   - Data subject rights procedures
   - DPIA completed (if high risk)
   - Data breach notification process (72 hours to ICO)
   - Records of Processing Activities (ROPA)

8. **For each CAF principle and control**:
   - Assess status: ✅ Achieved / ⚠️ Partially Achieved / ❌ Not Achieved / N/A
   - Gather evidence from project documents
   - Check relevant security controls
   - Identify gaps and risks
   - Provide specific remediation actions with owners and timelines

9. **Calculate overall CAF score**: X/14 principles achieved

10. **Identify critical security issues**:
   - Issues that block progression to next phase
   - Unacceptable risk levels
   - Regulatory non-compliance (UK GDPR, Data Protection Act)

11. **Generate actionable recommendations**:
    - Critical priority (0-30 days) - blockers for next phase
    - High priority (1-3 months) - significant risk reduction
    - Medium priority (3-6 months) - continuous improvement

12. **Detect version**: Before generating the document ID, check if a previous version exists:
    - Look for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-SECD-v*.md` files in the project directory
    - **If no existing file**: Use VERSION="1.0"
    - **If existing file found**:
      - Read the existing document to understand its scope
      - Compare against current inputs and project state
      - **Minor increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): Scope unchanged — refreshed assessments, updated control status, corrected details
      - **Major increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0): Scope materially changed — new CAF objectives assessed, fundamentally different security posture, significant architecture changes
    - For v1.1+/v2.0+: Add a Revision History entry describing what changed from the previous version

13. **Save the document**: Write to `projects/[project-folder]/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-SECD-v${VERSION}.md`




**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 1: Generate Document ID
```bash
# Use the ArcKit document ID generation script
DOC_ID=$(.arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh "${PROJECT_ID}" "SECD" "${VERSION}")
# Example output: ARC-001-SECD-v1.0
```

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):
- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → Determined version from step 11
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → Use the document purpose (e.g., "Business and Technical Requirements")
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-SECD-v[VERSION]` → Use generated DOC_ID from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → Current command name (e.g., "arckit.secure")

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):
- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):
- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.secure` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:
```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit.secure` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: [Read from VERSION file]
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### Example Fully Populated Document Control Section:

```markdown
## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | ARC-001-SECD-v1.0 |
