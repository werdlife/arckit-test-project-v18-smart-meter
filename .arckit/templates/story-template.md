### Chapter 7: Delivery Planning - From Requirements to Sprints

**Timeline**: [DATE] to [DATE] ([DAYS] days)

**What Happened**:

With approved designs, the project moved into detailed delivery planning, translating requirements into user stories and establishing operational frameworks.

**Key Activities**:

1. **Product Backlog** (`/arckit.backlog` - [DATE])
   - Converted [TOTAL_REQS] requirements into [TOTAL_STORIES] GDS-style user stories
   - Story format: "As a [user type], I need to [action], so that [benefit]"
   - Prioritization using MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
   - Sprint planning:
     - Total sprints: [N] sprints ([SPRINT_LENGTH]-week sprints)
     - Sprint 1-[N]: [M] stories each
     - Estimated duration: [WEEKS] weeks ([MONTHS] months)
   - Velocity assumptions: [STORY_POINTS] points per sprint
   - Created `projects/{project_id}/ARC-*-BKLG-*.md`

2. **ServiceNow Design** (`/arckit.servicenow` - [DATE])
   - **CMDB Design**: [N] Configuration Items mapped to architecture components
   - **SLA Design**: [M] SLAs defined
     - Priority 1 (Critical): [RESPONSE_TIME] response, [RESOLUTION_TIME] resolution
     - Priority 2 (High): [RESPONSE_TIME] response, [RESOLUTION_TIME] resolution
     - Priority 3 (Medium): [RESPONSE_TIME] response, [RESOLUTION_TIME] resolution
     - Priority 4 (Low): [RESPONSE_TIME] response, [RESOLUTION_TIME] resolution
   - **Incident Management**: Workflows, escalation paths, assignment groups
   - **Change Management**: CAB process, change windows, approval workflows
   - **Service Catalog**: [P] catalog items for self-service
   - Created `projects/{project_id}/ARC-*-SNOW-*.md`

**Backlog Summary**:

```mermaid
pie title User Stories by Priority
    "Must-have" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Should-have" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Could-have" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Won't-have (this phase)" : [PERCENTAGE]
```

**Timeline Context**:

Delivery planning took [DAYS] days ([PERCENTAGE]% of project). This phase established a [WEEKS]-week delivery roadmap with [N] sprints. [Analysis: "Efficient backlog creation was enabled by well-defined requirements" or "Extended planning was necessary for complex operational integration."]

**Traceability Chain**:

```
Requirements (BR/FR) → User Stories → Sprint Backlog
Architecture Components → CMDB Configuration Items
NFR-A-xxx (Availability) → SLA Targets
Requirements → ServiceNow Catalog Items
Stakeholders → ServiceNow Assignment Groups
```

**Artifacts Created**:

## Timeline Insights & Analysis

### Pacing Analysis

**Overall Pacing**: [ASSESSMENT: "Steady and measured" / "Accelerated" / "Extended with iterations"]

The project timeline shows [PATTERN: "consistent progress across all phases" / "front-loaded research and planning" / "iterative design refinement"]. Key observations:

- **Foundation Phase**: [DAYS] days - [ASSESSMENT: "Typical for establishing governance" / "Accelerated due to existing principles" / "Extended for stakeholder alignment"]
- **Requirements Phase**: [DAYS] days - [ASSESSMENT: "Comprehensive requirements gathering" / "Rapid definition" / "Iterative refinement"]
- **Procurement Phase**: [DAYS] days - [ASSESSMENT: "Efficient vendor selection" / "Thorough evaluation" / "Competitive tender process"]
- **Design Review Phase**: [DAYS] days - [ASSESSMENT: "Single-pass approval" / "Multiple iterations" / "Conditional approval with rework"]
- **Compliance Phase**: [DAYS] days - [ASSESSMENT: "Comprehensive validation" / "Streamlined checks" / "Deep security scrutiny"]

### Critical Path

The critical path through this project was:

```
[START] → Architecture Principles → Stakeholders → Risk → SOBC → Requirements → Research →
Wardley Maps → SOW → Vendor Selection → HLD Review → DLD Review → Backlog →
Traceability → [END]
```

**Longest Dependencies**:
1. [ACTIVITY_1] → [ACTIVITY_2]: [DAYS] days (rationale: [WHY])
2. [ACTIVITY_2] → [ACTIVITY_3]: [DAYS] days (rationale: [WHY])
3. [ACTIVITY_3] → [ACTIVITY_4]: [DAYS] days (rationale: [WHY])

**Parallel Workstreams**:

Some activities could have been parallelized:
- [ACTIVITY_A] and [ACTIVITY_B] (no dependencies)
- [ACTIVITY_C] and [ACTIVITY_D] (no dependencies)

### Timeline Deviations

**Expected vs Actual**:

| Phase | Expected Duration | Actual Duration | Variance | Reason |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| [PHASE_1] | [DAYS] days | [DAYS] days | [+/-DAYS] days | [REASON] |
| [PHASE_2] | [DAYS] days | [DAYS] days | [+/-DAYS] days | [REASON] |
| [PHASE_3] | [DAYS] days | [DAYS] days | [+/-DAYS] days | [REASON] |

**Key Factors Affecting Timeline**:
1. [FACTOR_1: e.g., "Extended stakeholder engagement due to organizational complexity"]
2. [FACTOR_2: e.g., "Accelerated requirements definition due to clear business drivers"]
3. [FACTOR_3: e.g., "Multiple design review iterations due to security concerns"]

### Velocity Metrics

**Command Execution Velocity**:
- Average: [COMMANDS_PER_WEEK] commands per week
- Peak: [MAX_COMMANDS] commands in week [N] ([DATE] to [DATE])
- Slowest: [MIN_COMMANDS] commands in week [M] ([DATE] to [DATE])

**Velocity Analysis**:

[Analysis: e.g., "The project maintained steady velocity throughout, with a peak during the requirements and research phase (weeks 3-5) when multiple artifacts were generated in parallel. The slowest week was during vendor evaluation, which required extended stakeholder consultation."]

### Lessons Learned (Timeline)

1. **What Went Well**:
   - [LESSON_1: e.g., "Early establishment of architecture principles accelerated all subsequent decision-making"]
   - [LESSON_2: e.g., "Wardley mapping enabled rapid build vs buy decisions"]

2. **What Could Be Improved**:
   - [LESSON_1: e.g., "Design reviews could have been parallelized with compliance assessments"]
   - [LESSON_2: e.g., "Earlier engagement with security team would have reduced design review iterations"]
