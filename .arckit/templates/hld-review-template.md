## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Overall Assessment

**Status**: [APPROVED | APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS | REJECTED]

**Summary**: [2-3 paragraph executive summary of the review outcome]

[Example: "The High-Level Design for the Payment Modernization project demonstrates a well-thought-out microservices architecture leveraging AWS cloud-native services. The design aligns with our API-first and cloud-first principles and adequately addresses most functional and non-functional requirements. However, several conditions must be addressed before proceeding to detailed design, primarily related to disaster recovery strategy and observability instrumentation."]

### 2.2 Key Strengths

- [Strength 1: e.g., "Modern, cloud-native architecture with appropriate use of managed services"]
- [Strength 2: e.g., "Comprehensive security controls with defense-in-depth"]
- [Strength 3: e.g., "Clear service boundaries aligned with domain-driven design principles"]

### 2.3 Key Concerns

- [Concern 1: e.g., "Disaster recovery plan lacks detail on failover procedures"]
- [Concern 2: e.g., "Observability strategy does not specify SLO/SLI definitions"]
- [Concern 3: e.g., "Integration with legacy system X requires further clarification"]

### 2.4 Conditions for Approval
