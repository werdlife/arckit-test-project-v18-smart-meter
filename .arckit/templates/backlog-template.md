## Backlog Maintenance

### Velocity Tracking
After each sprint, update:
- Actual velocity vs planned
- Velocity trend (improving, stable, declining)
- Adjust future sprint capacity accordingly

### Backlog Grooming Sessions
- **Weekly**: Refine next 2 sprints (add details, update estimates)
- **Bi-weekly**: Groom backlog beyond 2 sprints (reprioritize)
- **Monthly**: Review epic priorities (business changes)

### When to Re-Generate Backlog
- Requirements significantly changed
- New epics added
- Business priorities shifted
- Architecture redesigned

---

## Integration with Other ArcKit Commands

**This backlog was generated from**:
- `/arckit.requirements` - Source of all stories
- `/arckit.hld` - Component mapping
- `/arckit.stakeholders` - User personas
- `/arckit.risk-register` - Risk priorities
- `/arckit.business-case` - Value priorities

**Use this backlog with**:
- `/arckit.traceability` - Track requirements through implementation
- `/arckit.test-strategy` - Generate test cases from acceptance criteria
- `/arckit.analyze` - Validate backlog completeness

---

**Important Notes**:

⚠️ **Story Points Are Estimates**: AI-generated estimates should be validated by your team based on actual velocity and capacity. Use team poker for consensus estimation.

⚠️ **Velocity Will Vary**: Initial velocity (20 points) is assumed. Track actual velocity after Sprint 1 and adjust future sprints accordingly.

⚠️ **Dependencies May Change**: Technical dependencies are identified automatically but may need adjustment based on your team's approach and constraints.

⚠️ **Regular Refinement Required**: This backlog is a starting point. Teams should refine weekly and adapt based on learnings.
