- ⚠️ **AMBIGUOUS**: Service mentions related capability but vaguely (needs clarification)
- ❌ **NOT MENTIONED**: Service does not mention this requirement at all

### Ambiguous Claims Detection

Common vague marketing language requiring clarification:
- "Industry-standard" → Which specific standards?
- "High availability" → What specific SLA percentage?
- "Scalable" → To what capacity? What are the limits?
- "Secure" → Which security certifications?
- "Fast" → What specific performance metrics?
- "Compatible with" → Which versions? What level of compatibility?
- "Enterprise-grade" → What does this mean specifically?
- "Comprehensive" → What is included? What is excluded?

### Priority Levels

**🔴 CRITICAL** (Blocking):
- MUST requirement not confirmed at all (❌ NOT MENTIONED)
- Compliance requirement without evidence
- Blocker for procurement

**🟠 HIGH** (Affects Scoring):
- MUST requirement mentioned ambiguously (⚠️ AMBIGUOUS)
- Integration requirement unclear
- SLA not specified
- Certification mentioned but not confirmed

**🔵 MEDIUM** (Due Diligence):
- SHOULD requirement not mentioned
- Pricing details incomplete
- Data residency not confirmed
- Support terms unclear

**🟢 LOW** (Nice to Know):
- Nice-to-have features
- Future roadmap questions
- General support questions

### Risk Levels

- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: 1+ MUST requirements not confirmed → DO NOT PROCEED
- 🟠 **HIGH**: 2+ MUST requirements ambiguous → CLARIFY FIRST
- 🔵 **MEDIUM**: 1 MUST ambiguous OR 3+ SHOULD missing → PROCEED WITH CAUTION
- 🟢 **LOW**: All MUST confirmed, few SHOULD missing → PROCEED TO DEMO
